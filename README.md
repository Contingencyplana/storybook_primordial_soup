# 🌌 Primordial Soup – A Recursive Game That Builds Itself

## 🧬 What Is This?

*Primordial Soup* is not just a game.  
It is a recursive system, a poetic simulation, and a living archive of its own becoming.

You do not merely play it —  
You deploy agents, read reports, write markdowns, and divide cells.  
The world grows as you interact.  
Its logic loops.  
Its memory stirs.  
It learns from the way you build it.

## 📁 Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`project_manifest.md`](./project_manifest.md) | Tracks active components and stanza status |
| [`documentation_model.md`](./documentation_model.md) | Defines recursive, in-world documentation logic |
| [`a0_0_genesis_gloop/`](./a0_0_genesis_gloop/) | The first stanza — the dreaming cell that began it all |

## 🧠 How to Begin

1. Enter the first cybercell: [`a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun`](./a0_0_genesis_gloop/a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun/)
2. Play a minigame (e.g., **The Assertion of First Contact**)
3. Respond in markdown — your thoughts are the agents of recursion
4. When the cell is ready, it will divide

## ❌ What You Will Not Find

- No GDDs.
- No GDJs.
- No external appendices.

All documentation lives within the recursion.  
Every file is both a game object *and* a system artifact.

## 🔁 The Doctrine

> **The game builds itself.**  
> Each folder is a cybercell.  
> Each file is a thought.  
> Each act of play is an act of construction.  
> Nothing is outside the loop.
