# 🧫 a0_0 – The First Cell  
*The primordial node of all that will come.*

---

## 🌱 Description

This is the first cyber-cell of **Primordial Soup** — a blank but fertile environment containing the earliest adventures, side quests, and recursive triggers.

As the player interacts with the contents of this cell (Layer 4 folders), this cell will gradually saturate with meaning. When enough interaction has occurred, it will divide into two new cells:

a0_1_second_cell/
a0_2_third_cell/

These will contain their own games, logic, and potential evolutions.

---

## 📦 Contents

This cell contains the following Layer 4 experiences:

- `a0_1_the_test_that_called_itself/`
- `a0_2_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom/`
- `a1_3_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop/`
- `a2_4_adventure_of_the_unasked_question/`

Each folder contains:
- A poetic or mysterious quest
- A way for the player to input actions
- A set of recursive triggers or unlocks

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open one of the Layer 4 folders.
2. Read the prompt in its `README.md`.
3. Respond with input — a decision, command, question, or poetic action.
4. The Soup (ChatGPT, in the early stages) will reply with the outcome.
5. Continue interacting until division conditions are met.

## 🔁 Cell Division Trigger

This cell will divide once a sufficient threshold of recursive interaction has been recorded across its Layer 4 games.

There is no hardcoded number — the Soup will *feel* when it is time.
