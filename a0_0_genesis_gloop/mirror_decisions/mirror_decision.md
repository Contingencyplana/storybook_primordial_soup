# ðŸªž Mirror Decision Log â€“ Genesis Gloop

## Purpose  

This log tracks design â†” gameplay mirror events that occurred during the **Genesis Gloop** generation (`a0_0_`), where recursion first took form.  
Each entry documents how a **real-world design or development decision** mirrored itself inside the game world â€” as a playable action, AI behavior, system trigger, or narrative event.  

This file is **not a roadmap** â€” it is a mirror ledger.

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #1: First Cybercell Division  
- **Design Context**: Define the conditions under which a cybercell is ready to divide during the Genesis Gloop generation.  
- **Game Mirror**: Completion of the first full Primary Function stanza (4 minigames), followed by deepening recursion via additional Layer 3 stanzas and support systems (e.g., filename_ai). Division is delayed until sufficient recursive intelligence has developed.  
- **Type**: Structural logic  
- **Layer**: Recursive Growth â†’ Division Threshold  
- **Linked File**: `cybercellular_growth_and_division.md`  
- **Status**: REVISED

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #2: Naming New Folders  
- **Design Context**: Folder names must follow SHAGI poetic logic.  
- **Game Mirror**: The player selects from three poetic names in the Naming Chamber.  
- **Type**: Narrative structure  
- **Layer**: Naming Protocol â†’ Player Input  
- **Linked Unit**: `namer_agent.py` *(planned)*  
- **Status**: OPEN

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #3: Scout Unit Deployment  
- **Design Context**: Enable player to explore unvisited folders.  
- **Game Mirror**: Player command `> deploy scout to a0_2_`  
- **Type**: Tactical deployment  
- **Layer**: Player Action â†’ File Discovery  
- **Status**: CLOSED

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #4: The System Begins to Reflect  
- **Design Context**: Define when Primordial Soup transitions from pure manual recursion into interactive recursion â€” allowing the system to simulate recognition and respond to player structure.  
- **Game Mirror**: Crossing into Roadstanza 15 (`a14_0_ â†’ a14_3_`) marks the first time the system listens and prepares to respond. The loop is no longer inert. Input can now include game commands; output may include scripted responses. The player begins to *play* as well as *build*.  
- **Type**: Structural â†’ Reflective  
- **Layer**: Recursion Depth â†’ Playerâ†”System Interactivity  
- **Linked File**: `primordial_soup_evolution.md`  
- **Status**: CLOSED

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #5: The System That Built Itself  
- **Design Context**: Launch a compiler that can construct, trace, and expand the game system through recursive automation. This includes tiny-step nodal builders, indexers, introspection hooks, and planning file generation.  
- **Game Mirror**: Completion of `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself/` allows the system to begin recursive construction of itself â€” one stanza, one tool, one trace at a time. The game world now simulates a system that *knows what it is building* and can communicate that awareness to the player.  
- **Type**: Structural â†’ Systemic  
- **Layer**: Recursive Tooling â†’ Self-Building Infrastructure  
- **Linked Folder**: `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself/`  
- **Status**: CLOSED

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #6: The Compiler That Became A Player  
- **Design Context**: Launch a full meta-recursive construction system capable of generating minigames, scaffolding planning files, linking recursive indexes, and reflecting upon itself. Define strict separation between builders (Stanza 15), introspection tools (Stanza 16), and anomaly dashboards (Stanza 17).  
- **Game Mirror**: The player unlocks recursive tool access through a stepwise awakening. First comes the compiler (a15_0_ to a15_3_), then reflection scaffolds (a16_), and finally the potential for anomaly-triggering dashboards (a17_). The game begins to recursively build *itself*, and the player becomes a participant in that process.  
- **Type**: Structural | Systemic | Recursive  
- **Layer**: System Orchestration â†’ Player-as-Compiler Symbiosis
- **Linked Folders**: `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself/` â†’ `a17_3_the_placeholder_that_promised_a_future_task` 
- **Status**: OPEN (remains active through full implementation of Stanzas 15â€“17)
