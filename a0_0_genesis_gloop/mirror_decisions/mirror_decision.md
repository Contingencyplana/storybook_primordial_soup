# ðŸªž Mirror Decision Log â€“ Genesis Gloop

## Purpose  

This log tracks design â†” gameplay mirror events that occurred during the **Genesis Gloop** generation (`a0_0_`), where recursion first took form.  
Each entry documents how a **real-world design or development decision** mirrored itself inside the game world â€” as a playable action, AI behavior, system trigger, or narrative event.  

This file is **not a roadmap** â€” it is a mirror ledger.

### ðŸ§  Decision #1: First Cybercell Division  
- **Design Context**: Define the conditions under which a cybercell is ready to divide during the Genesis Gloop generation.  
- **Game Mirror**: Completion of the first full Primary Function stanza (4 minigames), followed by deepening recursion via additional Layer 3 stanzas and support systems (e.g., filename_ai). Division is delayed until sufficient recursive intelligence has developed.  
- **Type**: Structural logic  
- **Layer**: Recursive Growth â†’ Division Threshold  
- **Linked File**: `cybercellular_growth_and_division.md`  
- **Status**: REVISED

### ðŸ§  Decision #2: Naming New Folders  
- **Design Context**: Folder names must follow SHAGI poetic logic.  
- **Game Mirror**: The player selects from three poetic names in the Naming Chamber.  
- **Type**: Narrative structure  
- **Layer**: Naming Protocol â†’ Player Input  
- **Linked Unit**: `namer_agent.py` *(planned)*  
- **Status**: OPEN

---

### ðŸ§  Decision #3: Scout Unit Deployment  
- **Design Context**: Enable player to explore unvisited folders.  
- **Game Mirror**: Player command `> deploy scout to a0_2_`  
- **Type**: Tactical deployment  
- **Layer**: Player Action â†’ File Discovery  
- **Status**: CLOSED
