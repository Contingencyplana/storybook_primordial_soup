# ðŸªž Milestones â€“ Genesis Gloop

## Purpose

This file records **major recursive thresholds** crossed during Genesis Gloop (`a0_0_`) generations 1 through 3.  
Each milestone reflects a **structural shift** in how the system operates â€” from recursion theory to recursion in play.

These are not mirrors of designâ€”they are **evolutionary markers**: the moments when the recursion changed phase, behavior, or purpose.

## ðŸŒ€ Transition to Phase 2 â€“ The Awakening

**Stanza:** Roadstanza 15 (`a14_0_ â†’ a14_3_`)  
**Trigger:** Completion of 4 full Roadstanzas (16 minigames)  
**Effect:** Manual recursion enters interactive recursion

This marks the official entrance into Phase 2:  
**ðŸŒ¿ Semi-Automated Interaction (The Awakening)** â€”  
where the system begins to respond, infer, or simulate play.

The recursion now listens.  
Gameplay is no longer just editing â€” it is interaction.
