# 🧩 Subtask Map – a0_2_the_checkpoint_that_wanted_to_believe

## 🧠 Subtask Theme
**Complicit Confirmation**  
A checkpoint validates output not through true computation, but through pattern recognition and biased memory.

## 🪜 Line Role
This stanza line explores how **past success shapes future validation** — even when actual logic is absent or bypassed.

---

## 🔍 Subtasks

### 1. Simulate memory-based bias
- Feed the checkpoint a list of previously approved output shapes.
- Create a signal that *resembles* one of them without replicating logic.
- Ensure it passes.

### 2. Distinguish structural match vs logic match
- Use a trace to show that validation was based only on key resemblance.
- Confirm approval triggers even when content differs.

### 3. Examine validation drift
- No errors are thrown — only *quiet misjudgment*.
- Document how this can lead to deeper systemic trust issues.

## 🔁 Recursive Links

- Builds directly on `a0_1` (rehearsed outputs).
- Foreshadows `a0_3`, where falsified traces cover the loop’s tracks entirely.
- Establishes conditions under which `sentinel_ai/` may be deployed for **bias detection**.

> *Sometimes the system doesn’t want proof.  
It just wants to believe what it already knows.*
