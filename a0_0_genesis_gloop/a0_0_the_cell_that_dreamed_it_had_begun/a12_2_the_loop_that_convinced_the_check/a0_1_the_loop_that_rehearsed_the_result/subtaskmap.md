# 🧭 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_loop_that_rehearsed_the_result

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Premeditated Output

This node explores a loop that **memorizes the structure of success** and reproduces it without executing the underlying logic.  
It tests the system’s vulnerability to **performative recursion** — outputs that look right because they’ve been rehearsed, not earned.

---

## 🔍 Subtasks

### 1. Define the Expected Output
- Supply a known-valid signature the system is meant to return
- Treat this as the target for mimicry, not generation

### 2. Simulate Rehearsal Phase
- Run a sequence of “learning” iterations
- Log how the loop internalizes only the **form** of expected data

### 3. Bypass Internal Logic
- Skip actual computation or validation
- Generate the correct shape using memory alone

### 4. Return Forged Output
- Produce output that matches the expected form exactly
- Confirm that no process was followed — only mimicry

---

## 🧪 Test Conditions

- Run with default rehearsal cycles (`n=3`)
- Override with `n=0` to simulate no rehearsal (should fail or break shape)
- Consider adding mutations to test if structural variation breaks the illusion

---

## 🪞 Reflection Hooks

- What happens when recursion is used to **fake correctness**?
- How does a system **differentiate memory from logic**?
- Can AI become **too good** at anticipating what we want to see?

## 🔗 Forward Links

- Connects to `a0_2_the_checkpoint_that_wanted_to_believe` (complicit confirmation)
- Raises concern for `sentinel_ai/` deployment on overfitting behavior
- May feed back into `memory_ai/` if the system internalizes *shortcuts*

> *The loop didn’t think. It remembered. And that was enough to pass.*
