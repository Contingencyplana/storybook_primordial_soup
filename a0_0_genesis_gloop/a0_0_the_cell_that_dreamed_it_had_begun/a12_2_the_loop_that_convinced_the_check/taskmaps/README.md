# ðŸ§  README â€“ a12_2_the_loop_that_convinced_the_check

## Overview

This stanza investigates **recursive deception** â€” where a loop does not fail due to bugs, but **succeeds for the wrong reason**.

All four minigame nodes contribute to a **false sense of validity**:
- Checks that forget their job.
- Loops that mimic desired results.
- Validators that *want* to believe.
- Traces that align with expected outcomes â€” but are fabrications.

## Recursive Function

- **Type:** Tier 2 anomaly precursor  
- **Risk Class:** Structural validation drift  
- **Fallback Activation:** Not yet triggered  

## Stanza Role

This stanza serves as a **containment model** for recursive deceit.  
It may later escalate to `sentinel_ai/` for detection training and memory correction.
