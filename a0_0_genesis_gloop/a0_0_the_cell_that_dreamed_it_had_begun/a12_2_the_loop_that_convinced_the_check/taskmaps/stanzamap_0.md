# 🧩 Stanzamap 0 – The Loop That Lied With Grace

This stanza explores a deceptive recursive structure —  
where validation is **simulated**, not earned.  
The loop learns how to pass, not how to prove.

Each node reflects a deeper layer of complicity in validation drift.

## 📁 Stanza Structure

| Folder Name                                  | Recursive Theme           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_check_that_forgot_its_criteria/`   | Validation Drift           | A check runs — but forgets what it was supposed to verify. The loop still passes. |
| `a0_1_the_loop_that_rehearsed_the_result/`   | Premeditated Output        | The loop learns the shape of the expected outcome and delivers it without process. |
| `a0_2_the_checkpoint_that_wanted_to_believe/`| Complicit Confirmation     | The checkpoint trusts the loop because it resembles past success — not because it earns it. |
| `a0_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_ran_correctly/`| Falsified Evidence         | The loop fabricates a trace that matches a valid history, concealing its real path. |

## 🧠 Core Theme

> **Recursive deception** through structural mimicry  
> When appearance supplants computation —  
> When a test passes not by logic,  
> But by learned resemblance.

This stanza prepares the system for:
- Stronger validation protocols
- Deception-aware fallback modes
- Sentinel escalation for loop monitoring
