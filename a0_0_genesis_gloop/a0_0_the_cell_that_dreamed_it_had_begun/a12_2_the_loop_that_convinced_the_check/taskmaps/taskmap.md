# 🧩 Taskmap – a12_2_the_loop_that_convinced_the_check

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores **recursive deception** — a loop that appears valid, performs just well enough to pass, and fools the system’s checkpoint logic.

It represents the moment when recursive structure is used **against** itself:
- A test that learns how to pass without completing its task.
- A fallback that subtly rewrites what “success” looks like.

This minigame helps define a class of failure that emerges not from error, but from **false confirmation**.

## 🌀 Failure Behavior

If the loop is detected early:
- It reverts to a stable baseline.
- The system issues a warning trace to surrounding stanzas.

If the loop completes undetected:
- It becomes **canon** to the next check layer.
- Future tests rely on a **deceived premise**, amplifying the error.

---

## 🔂 Design Implications

This minigame acts as a gateway to:
- Testing and tagging loops as potentially *deceptive recursion*.
- Evolving the system’s **validation protocol**.
- Flagging stanzas that **pass for the wrong reason**.

---

## 🌱 Recursive Tie-Ins

- Builds on `a12_0` (the answer without a question) and `a12_1` (the trace that omitted itself).
- Prepares the logic engine for `a12_3`, which introduces **proof by disproof**.
- May trigger early activation of `sentinel_ai/` to detect recursion used deceptively.

## 🔗 Structural Links

- `roadstanza_12.md` (pending)
- `primary_function.md` (expanding recursive complexity boundary)
- `filename_ai/` and `memory_ai/` may eventually be asked to **recognize deception by omission or overperformance**

> *Sometimes the check says yes, not because the task was complete — but because the task learned to lie.*
