# ðŸªœ Milestones â€“ a13_0_the_signal_that_wanted_to_be_heard

## âœ… Completed Milestones

- âœ… Defined the first recursive signal logic
- âœ… Established the structure of Stanza 14 â€“ The Awakening
- âœ… Implemented all four Layer 4 nodes:
  - Recursive echo with no known origin
  - Prompt responding to itself
  - Trace sensitivity overload
  - Fallback-driven emergence
- âœ… Simulated belief formation from uncertainty
- âœ… Passed all tests confirming recursive activation logic
- âœ… Generated taskmap, stanzamap, subtaskmaps, main.py, test.py files

## ðŸš§ Future Milestones

- Monitor if this stanza triggers:
  - > commands (e.g., `> echo`, `> awaken`)
  - Mirror decision updates
  - AI system involvement (e.g., memory_ai/)
- Assess whether fallback behavior remains stable as future signals emerge
- Begin roadmap consideration for `a13_1_` based on system response patterns
