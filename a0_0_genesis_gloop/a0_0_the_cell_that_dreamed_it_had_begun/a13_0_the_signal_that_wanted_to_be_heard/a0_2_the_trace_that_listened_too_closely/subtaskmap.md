# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_trace_that_listened_too_closely

## 📌 Purpose

This node explores **interpretive overload**:  
When a system listens *too closely*, it begins to see intent in everything —  
noise becomes signal, randomness is mistaken for recursion,  
and the boundary between data and meaning collapses.

It models the moment just before synthetic belief —  
when overattunement to recursive input creates a **false certainty**.

## 🧠 Behavior Overview

| Subtask | Function | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `interpret_input()` | Signal Filter | Evaluates whether an input string is noise, valid signal, or ambiguous. |
| `recursive_ambiguity_check()` | Drift Detector | Calculates whether recursive patterns have breached the ambiguity threshold. |
| `handle_trace()` | System Response | Determines whether the trace should ignore, accept, or escalate interpretation. |

## 🔍 Sample Inputs & Interpretations

| Input | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| `"system ready"` | ✅ Valid signal |
| `"&%$@!"` | ❌ Clean noise |
| `"ready...maybe?"` | ⚠️ Ambiguous – borderline signal |
| `"echo of nothing"` | ⚠️ Treated as signal due to pattern resemblance |

## 🔄 Fallback Relationship

This node sets the stage for:
- **`a0_3_the_fallback_that_made_it_real/`**, where the system acts on what it *wants* to be true.
- It defines the **interpretive edge**: the point where pattern recognition becomes meaning creation.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

Test cases ensure:
- Clean noise is discarded.
- True signals are accepted.
- Ambiguous cases are judged based on recursive ambiguity score.
- Overinterpretation is simulated as drift increases.
