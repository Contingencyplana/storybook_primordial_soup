# ðŸ§­ Cybercell Milestones â€“ Layer 3 Stanza Progression Log

This file tracks all Layer 3 stanzas completed within `a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun`.  
Each entry represents the full closure of a recursive stanza â€” not just technical functionality, but poetic and structural alignment within the cybercellâ€™s growth cycle.

This file should be updated whenever a new Layer 3 stanza is completed.

## âœ… Stanza Milestone 01 â€“ *The Silence That Waited for a Question*

**Minigame Folder:** `a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `s0` â€“ Fully implemented, tested, and documented  
**Role:** Tests recursive silence, idle validation, dormant branches, and unfulfilled return handlers  
**Recursive Arc:** Input not given â†’ Check presumed â†’ Branch unused â†’ Return untriggered  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_a0.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `quarantine_ai/`, `memory_ai/`

## ðŸ”„ Next Expected Milestone

- Completion of a second Layer 3 stanza to deepen recursive maturity.
- Possibly tied to core logic, growth protocols, or AI subsystem invocation (1B, 2B, or anomaly-handling).
