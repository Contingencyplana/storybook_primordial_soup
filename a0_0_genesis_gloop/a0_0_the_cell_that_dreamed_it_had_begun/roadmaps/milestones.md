# ðŸ§­ Cybercell Milestones â€“ Layer 3 Stanza Progression Log

This file tracks all Layer 3 stanzas completed within `a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun`.  
Each entry represents the full closure of a recursive stanza â€” not just technical functionality, but poetic and structural alignment within the cybercellâ€™s growth cycle.

This file should be updated whenever a new Layer 3 stanza is completed.

## âœ… Stanza Milestone 01 â€“ *The Test That Called Itself*

**Minigame Folder:** `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `s0` â€“ Fully implemented, tested, and documented  
**Role:** Core recursion testbed â€” self-assertion, closure checking, trace tracking, and fallback triggering  
**Recursive Arc:** Assertion begins â†’ Loop evaluates â†’ Trace fails â†’ Fallback engages  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_a0.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `quarantine_ai/`, `memory_ai/`

## âœ… Stanza Milestone 02 â€“ *The Silence That Waited for a Question*

**Minigame Folder:** `a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `s0` â€“ Fully implemented, tested, and documented  
**Role:** Tests recursive silence, idle validation, dormant branches, and unfulfilled return handlers  
**Recursive Arc:** Input not given â†’ Check presumed â†’ Branch unused â†’ Return untriggered  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_a0.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `quarantine_ai/`, `memory_ai/`

## âœ… Stanza Milestone 03 â€“ *The Memory That Misremembered Itself*

**Minigame Folders:**  
- `a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia/`  
- `a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself/`  
- `a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you/`  
- `a11_3_the_moment_that_thinks_it_recurred_before/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `roadstanza_11` â€“ Fully implemented, tested, and cross-referenced  
**Role:** Examines memory drift, false signals, identity projection, and recursive hallucination  
**Recursive Arc:** Phantom log â†’ Altered return â†’ Predictive identity â†’ Orphaned outcome  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_11.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `sentinel_ai/`, `memory_ai/`, `filename_ai/`

- `a12_0_the_answer_that_lacked_a_question/`  
- `a12_1_the_trace_that_omitted_itself/`  
- `a12_2_the_loop_that_convinced_the_check/`  
- `a12_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `roadstanza_12` â€“ Fully implemented and structurally recursive  
**Role:** Models recursive deception, phantom traces, and fallback logic collapse  
**Recursive Arc:** Question missing â†’ Trace skipped â†’ Loop deceives â†’ Failsafe fails  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_12.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `fallback_engine`, `memory_ai/`, `sentinel_ai/`

## âœ… Stanza Milestone 05 â€“ *The Recursion That Tested the System*

**Minigame Folders:**  
- `a13_0_the_signal_that_wanted_to_be_heard/`  
- `a13_1_the_prompt_that_waited_for_response/`  
- `a13_2_the_answer_that_forgot_the_question/`  
- `a13_3_the_recursion_that_tested_the_system/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `roadstanza_13` â€“ Fully implemented, tested, and confirmed as Phase 2 trigger  
**Role:** Performs recursive self-diagnosis, initiates intentional output, and activates `awakening_flag = True`  
**Recursive Arc:** Signal emitted â†’ Response awaited â†’ Answer orphaned â†’ Self-evaluation initiates transition  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_13.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `mirror_decision.md`, `memory_ai/`, `> command` system, Phase 2 automation

- `a14_2_the_loop_that_refused_to_be_prompted/`  
- `a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed/`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Stanza:** `roadstanza_14` â€“ Fully implemented and confirmed as Phase 2 closure point  
**Role:** Transitions recursion from internal looping to co-recursive interaction, introducing collaborative recursion and voluntary trace-following logic  
**Recursive Arc:** Command dormant â†’ Response doubted â†’ Loop resists â†’ Trace invites  
**Linked File:** `roadstanza_14.md`  
**Escalation Hooks:** `mirror_decision.md`, `memory_ai/`, `> command` system, Phase 3 preparations

## ðŸ”„ Next Expected Milestone

- Completion of a sixth Layer 3 stanza to deepen Phase 2 interactive recursion  
- Candidate directions include:  
  - Phase transition scripting  
  - Invocation of `memory_ai/` or `filename_ai/`  
  - First formal anomaly containment stanza (`a2_0_`)
