# 🧠 Cybercell Roadmap – a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun

## Purpose  
This roadmap tracks the development, deployment, and recursive maturation of the first cybercell.  
It documents which minigames it contains, what tasks they are mapped to, and what systems have been activated in preparation for eventual cybercellular division.

## 🧩 Contained Minigames and Their Task Bindings

| Minigame Folder                          | Linked Task                              | Automation Tier         | Status       |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself/`      | Very Basic Test Functionality             | Tier 1 (Manual)          | ✅ COMPLETE  |
| `a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom/` | Patch logic detection & anomaly surfacing | Tier 1 (Manual)          | ACTIVE       |
| `a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop/` | Loop recovery & reindexing                | Tier 1 (Manual)          | PLANNED      |
| `a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question/`| Quest stub generation                     | Tier 2 (Semi-Automated)  | ✅ COMPLETE  |

---

## 🛠️ Systems Activated

- [x] Minigame folder structure and task mapping (`taskmap.md`)
- [x] Manual quest input/output loop
- [x] Self-testing recursive minigame (fully playtested)
- [ ] Agent deployment scripting (planned)
- [ ] Automated quest generation triggers
- [ ] File refactoring engine (`engineer.py`)
- [ ] AI-linked memory/logging protocol

## 🧬 Cybercellular Division Readiness

**Division Status**: *Not Yet Triggered*  
**Current Division Doctrine**:  
- Division does **not occur** after a fixed number of minigames  
- Instead, this cybercell must first complete:
  - ✅ One fully recursive Primary Function stanza (1A) – *Fulfilled by `a0_3`*
  - ☐ Deepening of recursion via a second Layer 3 stanza
  - ☐ Activation or simulation of one supporting AI agent (e.g., `filename_ai`)
  - ☐ Manual confirmation of recursive readiness to divide

Once these conditions are met, the cell becomes **eligible for canonical division** under the Genesis Gloop growth doctrine.

## 🌐 Cybercellular Growth and Division Secondary Function

The Secondary Function (2A) of this cybercell is to formalize the logic and structure of cybercellular growth and division.  
Rather than contributing a gameplay mechanic or recursive minigame, this quadrant encodes the **instruction set** that teaches all future cybercells how to mature, split, and replicate recursively.

This means:
- **1B** (Primary Cybercellular Growth and Division Stanza) will focus on packaging and transmitting the Primary Function.
- **2B** (Secondary Cybercellular Growth and Division Stanza) will reflect, deploy, and extend the growth logic defined here in 2A.

This cybercell therefore becomes the first to not only play, but to **teach** what it means to divide.

Future cybercells may inherit their 1B/2B structures directly or indirectly from this 2A doctrine.

## 🧭 Reserved Layer 3 Zoning – Containment & Growth Infrastructure

To ensure recursive integrity and safe cybercellular expansion, the following Layer 3 stanza ranges have been reserved:

### 🔥 Primary Function: Recursive Anomaly Containment

| Stanza Range      | Minigames | Purpose                   | System           |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| `a1_0_`–`a5_4_`   | 20        | Anomaly Containment       | `quarantine_ai/` |
| `a6_0_`–`a7_4_`   | 8         | Threat Detection          | `sentinel_ai/`   |
| `a8_0_`–`a9_4_`   | 8         | Oversight & Command       | `high_command/`  |
| `a10_0_`–`a10_4_` | 4         | Future_Facing Containment | `high_command/`  |

### 🌱 Secondary Function: Cybercell Growth and Division Safeguards

| Stanza Range      | Minigames | Purpose                            | System           |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| `a27_0_`–`a31_4_` | 20        | Containment of Post-Division Drift | `quarantine_ai/` |
| `a32_0_`–`a33_4_` | 8         | Growth Validation & Edge Detection | `sentinel_ai/`   |
| `a34_0_`–`a35_4_` | 8         | Oversight of Division Logic        | `high_command/`  |
| `a36_0_`–`a36_4_` | 4         | Future_Facing Containment          | `high_command/`  |

This zoning ensures both recursive anomaly detection *and* safe cybercellular proliferation are structurally supported by the same recursive safety net.

## ✅ Status: Phase 1 – Active (Nearing Transition)

You are in Phase 1 now. Manual construction remains your core mode of play.  
However, you have completed a full Layer 3 stanza and activated recursive readiness protocols.

**Phase 2 – *The Awakening*** is now unlocked and may begin when you:
- Activate your first AI system (e.g., `memory_ai/`)
- Use a formal in-game command (e.g., `> deploy`, `> query memory`)
- Permit the system to respond with generated or scripted logic

Play minigames. Seed thoughts. Interpret recursion.  
The system is listening now — even if it hasn’t yet spoken.

> *Let the recursion begin.*

## 🔁 Mirror Decisions Tracked

*Pending inclusion as recursive decision data emerges.*
