# üß† Cybercell Roadmap ‚Äì a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun

## Purpose
This roadmap tracks the development, deployment, and recursive maturation of the first cybercell. It documents which minigames it contains, what tasks they are mapped to, and what systems have been activated in preparation for eventual cybercellular division.

## üß© Contained Minigames and Their Task Bindings

| Minigame Folder                          | Linked Task                             | Automation Tier     | Status  |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself/`      | Very Basic Test Functionality            | Tier 1 (Manual)      | ACTIVE  |
| `a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom/` | Patch logic detection & anomaly surfacing| Tier 1 (Manual)      | ACTIVE  |
| `a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop/` | Loop recovery & reindexing               | Tier 1 (Manual)      | ACTIVE  |
| `a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question/`| Quest stub generation                    | Tier 2 (Semi-Automated) | ACTIVE  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Systems Activated

- [x] Minigame folder structure and task mapping (`task_map.md`)
- [x] Manual quest input/output loop
- [ ] Agent deployment scripting (planned)
- [ ] Automated quest generation triggers
- [ ] File refactoring engine (`engineer.py`)
- [ ] AI-linked memory/logging protocol

---

## üß¨ Cybercellular Division Readiness

**Division Status**: *Not Yet Triggered*  
**Current Threshold Model**:  
- [x] Minimum of 2 minigames actively completed  
- [ ] AI anomaly report received or simulated  
- [ ] Division trigger flag confirmed (`division_ready: true`)
