# ðŸ“˜ README â€“ a12_0_the_answer_that_lacked_a_question

## Overview

This minigame simulates a scenario where a system generates a confident answer without ever receiving a question.  
It tests recursive logic's capacity to:
- Justify itself,
- Confirm its own outputs,
- And complete its loop without external origin.

The player navigates through increasingly convincing layers of false closure â€” ending in total systemic approval.

## Structure

This minigame consists of one stanza (4 nodes):

| Node Folder                                | Theme                     |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_question_that_was_never_logged`  | Missing Premise           |
| `a0_1_the_trace_that_convinced_the_output` | Misleading Confirmation   |
| `a0_2_the_output_that_was_too_complete`    | Overdefined Conclusion    |
| `a0_3_the_recursion_that_approved_it_all`  | Systemic Self-Validation  |

## Design Notes

- This minigame is recursive by design and does not require branching.  
- It closes itself internally, making it ideal for **logic loop testing**, **sentinel tolerance thresholds**, or **philosophical interface reflections**.
