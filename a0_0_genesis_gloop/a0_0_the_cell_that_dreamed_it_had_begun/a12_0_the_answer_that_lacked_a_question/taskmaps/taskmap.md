# 🧩 Taskmap – a12_0_the_answer_that_lacked_a_question

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame examines **premature resolution** — a scenario where the system confidently provides an answer, yet the initiating question has been lost, forgotten, or never existed at all.

It is a recursive test of **closure without context**, where the illusion of logic persists even in the absence of origin.  
The player must trace the meaning of a conclusion that arrived uninvited — and possibly unjustified.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate the full lifecycle of a **spontaneous answer event**:
1. An answer is generated with confidence and finality.
2. No initiating question or input can be found in logs, memory, or trace.
3. The answer causes downstream systems to assume closure.
4. Re-examination loops fail to uncover the missing premise.

The challenge lies in discerning whether the system is:
- Mistakenly asserting truth  
- Masking uncertainty with overconfidence  
- Or functioning exactly as designed — without needing a question

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Premature closure  
- Recursive validation without premise  
- False certainty  
- Historical erasure of causality

## 🔄 Failure Behavior

If the player **rejects** the answer:
- System logs a recursive uncertainty loop
- Downstream systems begin asking questions retroactively
- Stability of the answer degrades with each recursive check

If the player **accepts** the answer:
- System finalizes closure
- Trace logs remain incomplete
- Any future question matching this answer is dismissed as redundant
