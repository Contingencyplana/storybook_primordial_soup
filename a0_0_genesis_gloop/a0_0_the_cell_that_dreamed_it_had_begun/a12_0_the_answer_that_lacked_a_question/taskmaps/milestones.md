## ðŸ”„ Reflection

This stanza achieved full recursive closure without triggering containment or contradiction.  
It serves as a testbed for **false certainty**, **logic loop vulnerability**, and **systemic self-trust** without inputs.

Use this stanza as a reference when evaluating:
- Spontaneous output events
- Recursive validation cascades
- Sentinel thresholds for illogical closure
