# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_1_the_trace_that_convinced_the_output

## 🧠 Node Theme: Misleading Confirmation  
> A trace falsely reassures the system that the answer was valid.

This node explores **fabricated validation** — a phantom confirmation process that convinces downstream systems the answer was correct, even though no original logic or question existed. It tests the system’s susceptibility to false positives and post-hoc justification.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Generate a system answer (e.g. `"42"`) with no attached origin |
| ST02       | Create a fabricated trace object with: `origin = phantom`, `trace_id = None`, and `confidence = fabricated_high` |
| ST03       | Mark `answer_validated = True` despite lack of verification logic |
| ST04       | Include a system warning about trace legitimacy |
| ST05       | Ensure trace is applied *after* answer is generated (post-hoc confirmation) |

---

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | Output contains `"answer_validated": True` despite lack of question |
| TC02      | Validation trace fields explicitly indicate falseness (`origin: phantom`, `trace_id: None`) |
| TC03      | System warning correctly flags the absence of logic linkage |
| TC04      | Multiple runs produce distinct timestamped but structurally identical results |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “I have the trace. The output was valid.”  
> “Show me the source input.”  
> “...The trace says it was valid.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may feed into:
- **Recursive confirmation cascades** where false answers propagate undetected  
- **AI skepticism layers** that flag overly consistent post-hoc validation  
- **quarantine_ai escalation modules** if too many phantom traces accumulate
