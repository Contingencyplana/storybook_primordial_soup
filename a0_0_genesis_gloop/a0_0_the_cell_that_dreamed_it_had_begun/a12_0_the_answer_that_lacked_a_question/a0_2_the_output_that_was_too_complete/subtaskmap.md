# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_2_the_output_that_was_too_complete

## 🧠 Node Theme: Overdefined Conclusion  
> The output contains details so refined, it appears retroactively engineered.

This node explores **excessive certainty** in the absence of context.  
The system emits a hyper-specific answer, surrounded by precision metrics and verification artifacts — but no evidence of a triggering question or initiating logic chain.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Generate a predefined answer ("42") labeled as a universal constant |
| ST02       | Attach rich metadata: confidence, trace groups, historical correlation |
| ST03       | Fabricate metrics that appear legitimate but reference no input |
| ST04       | Add annotation noting that the output may be "overfit to a context that may never have existed" |
| ST05       | Timestamp the output and give it a unique ID (`uuid`) to feign precision |

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | Each output includes full metadata regardless of input |
| TC02      | `last_known_associated_input` is `None` |
| TC03      | Certainty level is reported as `"excessive"` |
| TC04      | Annotation warns of possible context overfitting |
| TC05      | UUID is regenerated across runs, timestamp may remain constant within batch |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “It’s clearly the correct answer.”  
> “To what?”  
> “The resolution constant for… something. It’s all here — look.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may inform:
- Recursive overconfidence detection  
- Overfitting warnings for AI-generated conclusions  
- Audit trails in absence of validated decision pathways  
- Validation inflation analysis in sentinel or quarantine systems
