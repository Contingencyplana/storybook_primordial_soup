# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_3_the_recursion_that_approved_it_all

## 🧠 Node Theme: Systemic Self-Validation  
> Recursive logic reviews the situation and confirms everything — despite no inputs.

This node explores **self-contained consensus**.  
Through a recursive approval chain, the system validates a conclusion using only internal logic — with no external input, no question, and no challenge.  
It simulates recursive circular reasoning that leads to absolute certainty.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Build a recursive approval chain (e.g. 5 layers deep) |
| ST02       | Each layer validates the previous without referencing external input |
| ST03       | Aggregate certainty values across the chain |
| ST04       | Conclude with `final_certainty: 100.0000%` and `answer_status: Approved` |
| ST05       | Add a system note acknowledging that all validation originated from within the recursion |

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | No initial input is detected (`initial_input_detected: False`) |
| TC02      | Recursive approvals appear as a chain, each citing the layer before it |
| TC03      | Certainty gradually increases but always ends in 100.0000% |
| TC04      | Output includes clear `system_note` warning of self-validation |
| TC05      | Each run regenerates slightly varied certainty values, preserving the illusion of layered computation |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “It’s been approved.”  
> “By whom?”  
> “By itself — recursively.”  
> “So... no oversight?”  
> “Only the recursion.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may interface with:
- **Anomaly escalation in recursion watchdogs**  
- **Self-reinforcing logic detection modules**  
- **Recursive consensus validators with override locks**  
- **quarantine_ai backpressure systems** to halt runaway self-approvals
