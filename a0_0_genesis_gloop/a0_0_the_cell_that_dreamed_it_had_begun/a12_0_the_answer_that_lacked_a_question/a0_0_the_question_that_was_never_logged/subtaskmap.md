# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_0_the_question_that_was_never_logged

## 🧠 Node Theme: Missing Premise  
> A system generates logs for a question no one remembers asking.

This node explores **false certainty** rooted in **absent cause**.  
Despite no traceable input, the system confidently generates a definitive output — and logs it as if it were responding to something real.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Generate a confident answer with no initiating input |
| ST02       | Log system response including: timestamp, false input detection, null trace |
| ST03       | Make the output appear *authoritative* — as if the system was never in doubt |
| ST04       | Add a log note suggesting autonomy or memory corruption |
| ST05       | Allow test harness to repeat this behavior across multiple runs |

---

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | System prints an answer without any input source |
| TC02      | Log includes `input_detected: False` and `question_trace: None` |
| TC03      | Certainty remains "high" regardless of missing context |
| TC04      | All fields remain stable across multiple runs, with controlled timestamp behavior |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “We found the answer!”  
> “To what?”  
> “...We didn’t ask?”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may feed:
- Recursive doubt analysis modules  
- Anomaly containment escalation logic (e.g. `quarantine_ai`)  
- Stanza-wide contradiction detection systems
