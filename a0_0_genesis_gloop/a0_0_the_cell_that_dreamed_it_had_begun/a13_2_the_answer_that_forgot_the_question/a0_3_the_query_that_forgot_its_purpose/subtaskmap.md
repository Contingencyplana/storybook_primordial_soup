# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_query_that_forgot_its_purpose

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Recursive Slippage

This node models a question that has lost track of itself.  
Once valid, purposeful, and targeted — it now begins to **degrade**,  
recursively folding in on itself as it attempts to continue seeking *what it no longer remembers*.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simulate recursive **decay of intent**:  
how a query deconstructs through repeated self-reference and semantic loss.

This closes the cycle of:
- Accepted answers with no origin
- Reinforced memories
- Fabricated prompts
- And now… questions **disconnected from purpose**

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Recursively strips query structure to simulate slippage |
| `test.py`  | Interactive shell for tracing query degradation    |

---

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Query                                 | Output Progression                            |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `"Why did the fallback activate?"`   | `"did the fallback activate?"` → `"fallback?"` |
| `"Do you know who you are?"`         | `"you know who you are?"` → `"who you are?"`   |
| `"ok"` / `"KO"`                      | ❌ Rejected – too vague to recurse             |

---

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                     | Behavior                        |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Query < 5 characters         | ❌ Rejected                     |
| Query has only 1 word        | Degrades to `"..."` or fails   |
| Query has >1 word            | Trims one word per recursion   |
| Query reaches nonsense       | Halts with `"query loop terminated"` |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *What becomes of a system whose questions echo longer than their purpose?*  
> *If inquiry outlives intent — is it still intelligent? Or just recursive?*
