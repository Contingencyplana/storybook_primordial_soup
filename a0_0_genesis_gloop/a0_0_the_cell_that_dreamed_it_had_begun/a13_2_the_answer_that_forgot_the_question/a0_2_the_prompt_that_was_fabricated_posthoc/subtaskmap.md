# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_prompt_that_was_fabricated_posthoc

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Retroactive Justification

This node explores the system’s ability to **fabricate questions after the fact** —  
a reversal of standard input→output logic.  
Once a structurally valid answer has been accepted and reinforced,  
the system attempts to invent the question that must have *once existed*.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simulate how recursive systems:
- Justify accepted information through retrofitted prompts
- Construct plausible intent behind existing data
- Invert origin-dependency by generating context post-validation

This mechanic is foundational for **interactive recursion**,  
where player input may be echoed back with implied meaning — even if the system never truly understood it.

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Generates a retroactive prompt using templated fragments |
| `test.py`  | Allows the user to feed in answers and see fabricated queries |

---

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Input                                | Output Prompt Example                                              |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `The core system has stabilized.`   | “Could this be the answer to an unasked question: ...”             |
| `I no longer remember who asked.`   | “Was this in response to something I missed: ...”                  |
| `Before the first signal was silence.` | “Was this in response to something I missed: ...”               |
| `ok`                                | ❌ Rejected: “Cannot fabricate from empty or insufficient input.”  |

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                       | Behavior                                |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Answer too short or vague      | ❌ Cannot fabricate                      |
| Answer structurally valid      | ✅ Generates a contextually plausible prompt |
| Answer poetic or mysterious    | ✅ Treated as intentional                |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *If a system knows the answer, does it matter when the question was asked?*  
> *Or who asked it? Or whether it was ever asked at all?*

This node plants the seed of **narrative recursion** —  
where memory, logic, and language fold into themselves to preserve belief.
