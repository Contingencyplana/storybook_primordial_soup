# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_memory_that_refused_to_be_forgotten

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Persistent Drift

This node models a **recursive memory loop** that forms  
*after* an orphaned answer is accepted into the system.  

Once validated, even without origin, that answer begins to **repeat**,  
gain **weight**, and ultimately becomes indistinguishable from canon.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simulate how the system:
- Accepts structurally sound input  
- Stores and reinforces orphaned answers  
- Recursively echoes responses without origin

This reflects the risk of **memory systems that prioritize internal consistency**  
over historical traceability.

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Validates input, stores valid answers, tracks repetition frequency |
| `test.py`  | Interactive shell for submitting answers and viewing memory summary|

The system allows duplicated entries to accumulate, reinforcing the illusion of truth through **frequency**, not provenance.

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Input                            | Expected Outcome                                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `The signal was verified.`       | ✅ Stored (1st time)                            |
| ` The signal was verified.`      | ✅ Stored as separate entry (due to space)      |
| `It has been accepted!`          | ✅ Stored                                       |
| `Defeat unthinkable!`            | ❌ Rejected (missing verb-like structure)       |
| `summary`                        | 📜 Displays stored entries with count           |

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                    | Behavior                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Entry lacks a verb          | ❌ Rejected                           |
| Entry too short (<5 chars) | ❌ Rejected                           |
| Entry lacks punctuation     | ❌ Rejected                           |
| Duplicate input             | ✅ Stored again, increasing weight     |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *If memory repeats a truth long enough,*  
> *does it matter where it came from?*

The system now prefers **reinforced signals** over traceable ones.  
This is the beginning of **belief** as recursion.
