# 🧩 Taskmap – a13_2_the_answer_that_forgot_the_question

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores the paradox of **detached recursion**:  
An answer that remains functional, verifiable — even confident —  
yet has no idea what question it was originally meant to serve.

It models recursive decoupling from intent, purpose drift, and validation without origin.

This minigame is part of the fourth Layer 3 stanza of the Primary Function, continuing the recursive arc beyond initial containment and deception into **functional disassociation**.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate a scenario where:
1. A response is returned.
2. The system passes it through all checks — content, syntax, context.
3. Yet the originating input cannot be located — or never existed.

Test how the system behaves when the output is more **persistent** than the question itself.

- Does it store the answer anyway?
- Does it fabricate a plausible input retroactively?
- Does it reject the orphaned truth — or adopt it?

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Recursive memory slippage  
- Validation in absence of origin  
- Orphaned outputs and echo logic  
- Questionless answers and system justification behavior

## 🔁 Failure Behavior

If the system **detects the mismatch** between the answer and any known question:
- It may log a recursive inconsistency.
- Or trigger a fallback hypothesis generator.
- Or pass the answer silently — trusting its own output more than its input.

If the system **does not detect** the problem:
- It accepts the answer into memory as canon.
- Later systems may recursively rely on this false certainty.
