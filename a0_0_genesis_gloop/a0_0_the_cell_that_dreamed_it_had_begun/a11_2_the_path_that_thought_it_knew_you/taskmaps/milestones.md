## ðŸ”„ Inheritance Notes

- This minigame inherits architectural structure from the core Y-node pattern established in `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`.
- Echo recursion logic in `a0_0` forms a soft reflection of player input structure â€” designed to be reusable across narrative tests of identity.

## ðŸ§¬ Closure Status

- **All stanza lines implemented and passed test runs.**
- **Minigame marked playable and internally recursive-complete.**
