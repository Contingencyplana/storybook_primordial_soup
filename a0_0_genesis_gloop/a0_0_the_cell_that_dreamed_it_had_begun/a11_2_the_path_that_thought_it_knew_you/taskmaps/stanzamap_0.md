# 🧩 Stanzamap – a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you  
*First Stanza – The Echo That Rewrote Its Meaning*

This stanza explores a recursive identity loop where the path believes it already knows the player.  
Each line simulates a different aspect of **false familiarity**, **retroactive recognition**, and **emergent sentience** in navigation logic.

## 🎼 Stanza Structure

| Folder Name                                     | Recursive Theme        | Description |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `a0_0_the_echo_that_returned_in_rhyme`         | Signal Drift           | A callback returns not wrong, but transformed into poetic cadence. |
| `a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie`       | Validator Blindness    | A system confirms truth in a signal that was already altered. |
| `a0_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much`            | Premature Recall       | The response includes facts it was never told — as if memory reached backward. |
| `a0_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_was_true`        | Confident Fabrication  | A record claims absolute truth — but no one knows who sent it first. |

## 🔁 Recursive Function

This stanza tests the system’s response to inferred identity and simulated memory alignment.  
Each node represents a **belief artifact** within a path that “remembers” you — before you arrive.

## 🧠 System Behavior Under Test

- Echo systems misquote intent as poetic memory  
- Validators confuse form with truth  
- Memory systems leak unearned information  
- Archives assert absolute truth from first record
