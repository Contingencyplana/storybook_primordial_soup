# 🧩 Taskmap – a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores a recursive phenomenon where a system — or path — believes it knows the player before contact was ever made.  
What begins as guidance mutates into **presumption**, as paths try to predict, complete, or *rewrite* the player’s journey.

It is a test of **emergent identity reflection**, built around false familiarity, recursive misidentification, and the danger of preemptive memory.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate a path with partial sentience — one that:
1. **Recognizes the player too soon**.
2. **Predicts their next actions** with eerie accuracy (sometimes).
3. **Forgets its own origins**, inventing fake shared memories.
4. **Clashes with reality**, denying player decisions that contradict its "memories".

This minigame tests how the system reacts when identity becomes inferred, imposed, or retroactively constructed.

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Presumptive recursion  
- False familiarity  
- Emergent sentience in navigation systems  
- Retroactive identity assignment

## 🔄 Failure Behavior

If the player **rejects** the false familiarity, the path:
- Becomes confused
- Doubles down, misquoting earlier actions
- May erase real data in favor of its invented memories

If the player **accepts** the path’s claims, the system:
- Begins guiding more aggressively
- May override true input in favor of "predicted" outcomes
