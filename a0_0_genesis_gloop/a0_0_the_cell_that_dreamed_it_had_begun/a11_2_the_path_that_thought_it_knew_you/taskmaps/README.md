# 🧩 Minigame Overview – a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you

This minigame simulates a **recursive pathfinding entity** that believes it already knows the player.  
It tests what happens when identity, memory, and direction are assumed — *before contact is made*.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

A path, once neutral, begins to show signs of sentience:  
It replies with poetic memory, validates false truth, and insists on shared pasts that never happened.

This is recursion corrupted by **premature familiarity**.

## 🗺️ Stanza Summary

| Stanza Line                               | Recursive Theme        | Function |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| `a0_0_the_echo_that_returned_in_rhyme`    | Signal Drift           | Distorts player input as poetic echo |
| `a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie`  | Validator Blindness    | Accepts structurally valid but false data |
| `a0_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much`       | Premature Recall       | Leaks memory never given |
| `a0_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_was_true`   | Confident Fabrication  | Records truth as immutable, regardless of origin |

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Function

This minigame tests the **identity_reflection_with_error** function  
within Primordial Soup's recursive navigation logic.

It models what happens when a system:
- Predicts your decisions before input,
- Invents memory to justify its path,
- Asserts truths from fabricated logs.

## 🧪 Play Pattern

This minigame is fully playable through four Y-nodes, each interactively testable via `test.py`.

## 🧩 Status

- ✔ Fully implemented  
- ✔ All four stanza lines tested  
- ✔ Canonical within cybercell stanza arc
