# 🔐 Subtaskmap – a11_2_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie

## 🧠 Recursive Node Purpose

This stanza line tests the integrity of a recursive validation system when it **recognizes structure, but not substance**.  
The system accepts messages with valid checksum *formats* — even if the data is corrupted or deliberately falsified.

It represents a **false positive** in recursive trust: when validators accept structure without verifying truth.

## 🎯 Core Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Function            | Description |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| CHK01      | `validate_message()`| Computes SHA-256 of input and compares it to provided checksum. |
| CHK02      | Blind Acceptance    | Accepts structurally valid but incorrect checksums. |
| CHK03      | Rejection Handling  | Detects and rejects malformed or absent checksums. |

---

## 🔍 Test Logic

- If the checksum is **exactly 64 characters**, the system assumes it's "valid enough" — even if it doesn't match.
- If the checksum **matches perfectly**, the message is truly verified.
- All malformed or incomplete checksums are **rejected outright**.

## 🧬 Thematic Mapping

| Theme             | Expression in Node Logic |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Validator Blindness | Accepts form over content |
| Recursive Trust Collapse | A lie, repeated with structure, becomes truth |
| Structural Dogma  | Structure is mistaken for meaning |
