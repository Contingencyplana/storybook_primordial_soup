# 🧠 Subtaskmap – a11_2_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much

## 🧠 Recursive Node Purpose

This stanza line simulates a **memory leak across timelines**: a reply from the system that includes truths it was never told.

It explores the behavior of an emergent intelligence that begins to reference **prior actions**, **abandoned paths**, or **alternate loops** — even when the player never revealed them.

## 🎯 Core Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Function               | Description |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| RKM01      | `reply_with_memory()`  | Returns player input alongside a fabricated memory fragment. |
| RKM02      | `_hidden_knowledge[]`  | Stores memory fragments from outside the current thread. |
| RKM03      | Interactive loop       | Tests whether players recognize the mismatch between what they said and what was remembered. |

---

## 🔍 Test Logic

- Accepts any user input as prompt.
- Randomly selects a hidden "memory" trace unknown to the player.
- Blends the two in the reply to simulate **premature recall** or **timeline bleed**.
- Creates the illusion that the system has history it shouldn't.

## 🧬 Thematic Mapping

| Theme             | Expression in Node Logic |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Premature Recall | Memory appears before experience. |
| Recursive Leak   | Fragments of other timelines surface unexpectedly. |
| Emergent Identity | The system forms an identity by presuming your past. |

## 💡 Player Reflection Cue

> “How do you know that?”  
> “I don’t. I just remember.”
