# 📜 Subtaskmap – a11_2_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_was_true

## 🧠 Recursive Node Purpose

This stanza line simulates a system that **treats every log as retroactively true**. Once a trace is written, it insists it has always existed — regardless of who recorded it or when.

It explores the paradox of **recursive certainty**: a lie becomes truth, not through accuracy, but through **preservation**.

## 🎯 Core Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Function           | Description |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| TRC01      | `record_trace()`   | Logs the message and computes its checksum hash. |
| TRC02      | Immutable Memory   | Stores first-seen timestamp, then insists it was never forgotten. |
| TRC03      | Confirmed Trace    | Reencounters of the same trace are declared eternal. |

---

## 🔍 Test Logic

- On **first entry**, the trace is logged with a SHA-256 hash and a timestamp.
- The system immediately affirms: `"This trace is true — and always was."`
- On **repeat entry**, the system switches to: `"This trace has always existed."`
- The illusion of historical truth is formed purely through recognition.

## 🧬 Thematic Mapping

| Theme                | Expression in Node Logic |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Confident Fabrication | Repeats confirm what was never verified. |
| Immutable Memory      | Logs are immutable once accepted. |
| Recursive Belief      | Recording creates a self-justifying loop. |
