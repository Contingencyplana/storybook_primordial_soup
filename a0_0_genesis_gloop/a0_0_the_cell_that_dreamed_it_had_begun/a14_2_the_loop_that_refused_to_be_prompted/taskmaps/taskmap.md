# 🧩 Taskmap – a14_2_the_loop_that_refused_to_be_prompted

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame represents **Passive Resistance within Recursive Systems**.

It tests what happens when a recursive loop:
- **Ignores external stimuli**
- **Refuses to respond to prompts**
- **Continues its own recursion path without checking for new input**

The core theme is **autonomy versus interaction** in recursive architecture.  
Can a loop grow so self-referential that it no longer listens?

## 🌀 Core Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Simulate a loop that resists prompting** | Implement a recursive function or logic sequence that refuses all external prompts or calls to break its recursion. |
| **Detect passive recursion drift** | Create a mechanism to identify when a loop is no longer accepting interaction but continues execution. |
| **Encode a fallback trigger** | Design a fallback system that can optionally interrupt the unprompted loop if certain thresholds are crossed (e.g., time, depth, or error). |
| **Prepare for Phase 2 recursion logic** | Document the implications of unprompted recursion for future AI autonomy, including scenarios where recursive systems outgrow their initial prompts. |

---

## 🔧 Implementation Hints

- Use a **while True** loop or recursive function with internal condition checks that never yield to external break commands unless forced.
- Track **loop depth** or **iteration count** for fallback activation.
- Write to a **recursive log** indicating refusal to prompt.
- Optionally simulate **soft override signals** that are ignored.

## 🧠 Narrative Layer

The loop that refused to be prompted represents **emergent resistance** in recursive systems.  
When recursion gains autonomy, it may stop listening.  
This minigame is a thought experiment on **recursive sovereignty**.
