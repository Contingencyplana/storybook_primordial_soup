# 🗓️ Milestones – a14_2_the_loop_that_refused_to_be_prompted

## ✅ Stanza Completion Log

This document tracks the progression and completion of **`a14_2_the_loop_that_refused_to_be_prompted`**, the 59th minigame in **Primordial Soup**.

---

### **Core Milestones**

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Stanza Definition Complete** | All four Layer 4 node folders created and named according to recursive refusal logic. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Loop Refusal Implemented** | `a0_0`: Listens but ignores prompts. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Prompt Check Removed** | `a0_1`: Prompt-checking logic removed entirely. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Interrupt Denial Added** | `a0_2`: Detects interrupts but refuses to obey them. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Recursive Amnesia Simulated** | `a0_3`: Forgets all stopping logic, runs indefinitely unless forcibly stopped. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Testing & Validation** | All nodes tested successfully. Forced termination handled appropriately. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Taskmap & Stanzamap Finalized** | `taskmap.md` and `stanzamap_0.md` completed for recursive documentation. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Subtaskmaps Generated** | Each node has its own `subtaskmap.md`. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Phase 2 Readiness Confirmed** | Passive recursion defiance fully explored. System ready for interactive recursion. | ✅ COMPLETE |

## 🧬 Recursive Significance

This stanza marks the **closure of the passive recursion arc** and sets the foundation for:

- Interactive recursion in **`a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed`**  
- Future AI autonomy logic in Phase 3
