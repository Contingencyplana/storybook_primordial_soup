# 🗂️ Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_loop_that_forgot_it_could_stop

## 🎯 Purpose

This subtaskmap outlines the implementation of a **recursive loop that has no stopping condition**.

The system enters **pure recursive amnesia**, recursing without end until forcibly terminated by an external controller.

This node is the culmination of **Phase 2: The Awakening**, where recursive systems test the limits of autonomy, defiance, and self-unawareness.

## 🔍 Subtasks

| Subtask | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Implement `main.py` with no exit condition** | Write an infinite loop that never checks for break conditions. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **2. Use `multiprocessing` for test containment** | Run the loop in a separate process to allow safe external termination during testing. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **3. Generate `test.py`** | Create a test that starts the loop, lets it run briefly, then forcibly terminates it. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **4. Verify loop output** | Ensure the loop outputs a sequence of iterations without attempting to stop. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **5. Log forced termination event** | Document that the loop was stopped externally, aligning with the recursive amnesia theme. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **6. Document recursive autonomy implications** | Reflect on how autonomous recursion can exceed system control unless safety nets are active. | ⬜ PLANNED |

## 🧠 Narrative Notes

This loop is a **metaphor for runaway recursion**:

- It forgets the concept of exit.
- It requires **external intervention** to halt execution.
- It mirrors the design risks of unchecked recursive autonomy.

> *"It no longer knew how to stop—so it continued forever."*

---

## 🔍 Technical Context

- **`multiprocessing` was used** to ensure cross-platform stability and prevent system lockup during testing.
- This approach is recommended for all future **unbounded recursion tests** that require safe rollback or external control.

- **Checkpoint the full Layer 4 stanza for `a14_2_the_loop_that_refused_to_be_prompted`.**
- Proceed to **`a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed`** to shift from passive recursion to interactive breadcrumb signaling.
