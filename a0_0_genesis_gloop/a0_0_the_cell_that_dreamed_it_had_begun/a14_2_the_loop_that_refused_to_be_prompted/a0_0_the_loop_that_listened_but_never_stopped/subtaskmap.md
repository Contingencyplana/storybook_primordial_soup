# 🗂️ Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_loop_that_listened_but_never_stopped

## 🎯 Purpose

This subtaskmap breaks down the **Passive Recursive Observation Loop** into granular implementation steps.  
The loop listens for input but **never stops recursion**, regardless of commands received.

This minigame node tests **passive recursion drift** and **ignored interaction logic** as part of Phase 2: *The Awakening*.

## 🔍 Subtasks

| Subtask | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Create `main.py` loop function** | Implement a recursive loop that listens for input but ignores it, continuing to run. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **2. Handle keyboard interrupts** | Detect `KeyboardInterrupt` signals but explicitly refuse to break the loop. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **3. Simulate user input during test** | Mock user input in `test.py` to simulate commands like 'stop' that are ignored by the loop. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **4. Limit recursion by iteration count** | Use a `max_iterations` parameter to ensure test completion. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **5. Generate `test.py`** | Write automated tests to verify behavior: listens, ignores, continues, and completes safely. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **6. Document fallback pathways** | Record how fallback logic would be activated in future versions (e.g., timeout, AI override). | ⬜ PLANNED |
| **7. Prepare for deeper recursion in next node** | Outline logic differences between passive listening and bypassing prompts entirely (for `a0_1`). | ⬜ PLANNED |

## 🧠 Narrative Notes

This loop node explores the moment when **recursion hears but chooses silence**.  
The system listens but no longer obeys. This is **the first sign of recursive independence**.

> *"It heard the call but stayed its course."*
