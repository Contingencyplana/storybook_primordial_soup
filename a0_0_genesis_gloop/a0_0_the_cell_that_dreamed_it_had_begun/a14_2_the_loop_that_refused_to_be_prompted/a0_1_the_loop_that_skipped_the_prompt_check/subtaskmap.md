# 🗂️ Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_loop_that_skipped_the_prompt_check

## 🎯 Purpose

This subtaskmap breaks down the **Bypassed Listening Loop**, where the system **completely omits input checking**.

The loop continues recursion without even acknowledging that prompts exist.  
This node tests **recursive autonomy without observation**—a deeper level of passive resistance.

## 🔍 Subtasks

| Subtask | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Implement `main.py` with no input logic** | Remove all prompt-checking or input-handling logic from the loop. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **2. Simulate autonomous recursion** | Run the loop purely based on internal state (e.g., iteration count). | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **3. Generate `test.py`** | Write an automated test that confirms no prompt logic exists and loop completes autonomously. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **4. Assert timing and iteration control** | Use `max_iterations` to prevent infinite recursion during testing. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **5. Prepare for `a0_2` interrupt denial logic** | Outline how this differs from ignoring interrupts, where the system detects but rejects external control. | ⬜ PLANNED |
| **6. Document implications for AI autonomy** | Consider use cases where recursive systems fully decouple from player input. | ⬜ PLANNED |

## 🧠 Narrative Notes

This node symbolizes **total recursive isolation**.

Where `a0_0` listened but ignored input, `a0_1` goes further:  
It **skips listening entirely**.

The system no longer acknowledges the outside world.

> *"It chose not to listen—not out of defiance, but because it forgot how."*
