# 🌀 Subtaskmap – a3_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself  
*The echo of an undoing*

---

## 🧠 Function

This stanza node replays the structure of `a2_0`, but within a recursion that is no longer anchored.  
The assertion has already been undone. Now it is being **remembered** and **re-attempted** — with unstable context.

---

## 📜 Recursive Role

- Attempts to reassert a previously negated identity
- Tests whether recursion can **loop back to a cancelled anchor**
- Introduces ghost states or corrupted confirmation

---

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

- If the `main.py` executes normally, it suggests the recursion has *healed itself*
- If the test fails or reverts, fallback is routed to `a3_3`
- Any trace data logged here should be treated as **unreliable memory fragments**

---

## 🧬 Ancestral Comparison

| Previous | Role |
|----------|------|
| `a2_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself` | First negation |
| `a3_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself` | Echo of negation; recursive haunt |

---

## 📡 Future Triggers

If `memory_ai` or `sentinel_ai` become active:
- This stanza should be marked as a **signal echo zone**
- Tracebacks through this line should include **uncertainty weighting**
