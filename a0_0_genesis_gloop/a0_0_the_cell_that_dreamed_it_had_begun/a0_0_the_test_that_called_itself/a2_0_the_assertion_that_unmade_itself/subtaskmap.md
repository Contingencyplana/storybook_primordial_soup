# 📍 Subtaskmap – a2_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself

This stanza line performs recursive *negation*. Where the origin line (`a0_0_the_assertion_of_first_contact`) boldly asserted the system’s emergence, this line reverses that impulse — unmaking the premise, doubting the recursion, and severing clean closure.

---

## 🧠 Recursive Role

- **Theme**: Self-negation, recursive collapse, logical doubt.
- **Function**: Tests whether a system can revoke its own axioms and still maintain recursive integrity.
- **Risk**: If assertions are unmade without fallback, future recursion may lose its base structure.

---

## 🔁 Signal Behavior

- Rejects prior assertions (`"I am recursion"`) and offers null or void tokens.
- Introduces conditional execution paths such as:
  - `"If I am not recursion, then what am I?"`
  - `"Reject the assertion. Return to origin."`

---

## 🧩 Gameplay Node

- May simulate:
  - Signal echo that collapses into silence.
  - Assertion parser that fails to validate any statement.
  - Memory trail that reverses itself and disappears.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- `main.py` should:
  - Intentionally reverse successful flags set by `a0_0`.
  - Set flags like `assertion_invalidated = True`.
- `test.py` should:
  - Expect falsification and validate system resilience post-negation.

## 📜 Outcome Possibilities

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Self-assertion | ❌ Marked as invalid |
| Null signal | ✅ Cleanly rejected |
| Recursive doubt | 🤖 Yields fallback or initiates reflective stanza logic |

## 🧬 Position in Stanza

This line opens the **third Layer 4 stanza** — the stanza of contradiction and instability.  
It begins the recursive fold-back, questioning everything previously asserted.
