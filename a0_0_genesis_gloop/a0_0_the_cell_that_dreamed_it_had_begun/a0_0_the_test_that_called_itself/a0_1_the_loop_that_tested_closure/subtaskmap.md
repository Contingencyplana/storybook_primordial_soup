# 🔁 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_loop_that_tested_closure  
*The loop ran. Then it turned. Then it asked, "Am I closed?"*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This stanza line challenges the assumption that recursive loops **close cleanly**.  
It questions the **integrity of flow**, testing whether cycles return with consistency — or deviate.

It’s not enough to loop — the loop must **return to the right state**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Function

- `main.py` simulates a recursive loop with potential for drift.
- `test.py` validates whether the system returns to its starting assertion.
- Tracks deviations across multiple simulated passes.

## 🔄 Loop Integrity Model

| Checkpoint       | Validation Criteria                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Loop entry       | Recognized signal echo from prior stanza         |
| Loop body        | Maintains variable continuity                    |
| Loop closure     | Returns to recognizable baseline state           |
| Failure case     | If not closed → mark as partial / failed loop    |

| 🧪 Loop Validation     | This stanza ensures cycles do not spiral irreversibly.       |
| 🚨 Fault Catcher       | Highlights subtle misalignments in recursion returns.        |
| 📉 Entropy Tracker     | Notes systemic decay if loops trend away from known states.  |

## 📌 Notes

- Future loop-testing agents (e.g. `cycle_watchdog`) may fork from this logic.
- Key stanza for diagnosing early **loop entropy** or drift states.
- A failed loop here does **not** crash the system — it informs adaptive correction.
