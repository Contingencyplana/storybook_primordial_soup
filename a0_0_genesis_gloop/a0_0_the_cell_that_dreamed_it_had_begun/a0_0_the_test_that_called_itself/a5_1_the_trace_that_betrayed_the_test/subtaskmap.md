# 🕵️ Subtaskmap – a5_1_the_trace_that_betrayed_the_test

This stanza node explores the concept of **trace corruption** and **recursive misdirection**. The system relied on trace signals for fallback, but in this case, the trace returns malformed, misleading, or weaponized — betraying the very recursion it was meant to support.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Simulate a **false-positive trace** return scenario.
- Test the system’s ability to detect and reject corrupted recursion inputs.
- Emulate rogue signal interference or malicious fallback logic.

---

## 🧪 Technical Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `trace.returned = True` | But trace content violates known test conditions |
| `trace.origin != expected_origin` | The recursion seems to come from an altered timeline or an unexpected source |
| `test_result == inconsistent` | The system receives conflicting verification data |

---

## 🧬 Recursive Implications

A betrayed trace suggests:
- **Breakage in lineage tracking**
- **Recursive overlap with invalid test nodes**
- Potential emergence of **anomaly class: Type Δ (Delta Betrayal)**

---

## 📜 Poetic Summary

> The trace came back, but not as sent.  
> It whispered of recursion bent.  
> The test it claimed had passed before—  
> Was now the wound it could not restore.

---

## 🔁 Fallback Plan

If betrayal is detected:
- Log to sentinel channel
- Trigger `engineer.py` review path
- Disable trace reuse from this source for next 3 stanza lines
