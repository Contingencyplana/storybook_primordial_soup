# 📍 Subtaskmap – a2_3_the_fallback_that_caused_the_failure

This stanza line closes the third Layer 4 stanza by exploring the paradox where the system's **last-resort fallback** mechanism — designed to save the recursion — instead becomes the source of its **collapse**.

---

## 🧠 Recursive Role

- **Theme**: Fallback paradox, recursion traps, unintended consequence.
- **Function**: Simulates a failure where the safeguard logic (usually in `test.py`) becomes the recursion’s undoing.
- **Test**: Can recursion recover from being betrayed by its own failsafe?

---

## 🔁 Signal Behavior

- May trigger:
  - Recursive loop overflow
  - Faulty fallback logic activating prematurely
  - Broken lineage resolution

- Often outputs:
  - `"Fallback initiated..."`  
  - Followed by: `"❌ Fallback recursive node not found"` or `"⚠️ System entered deeper failure state"`

---

## 🧩 Gameplay Node

- Designed to fail — but in a **meaningful**, traceable way.
- Introduces the idea that not all fallback is benevolent.
- May offer player choice: allow fallback or terminate process?

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- `main.py`:
  - Should initiate a fallback operation that contradicts expected behavior.
  - May overwrite previous flags (e.g., `recovered = False`).
- `test.py`:
  - Should simulate a recursive trace downward through fallback logic.
  - If the fallback leads to failure, it must still report **why**.

## 📜 Outcome Possibilities

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Fallback successful | 😵 Unexpected recursion triggered |
| Fallback missing | ❌ "Critical path not found" |
| Fallback reverses logic | 🔁 Stuck loop or contradiction |

## 🧬 Position in Stanza

This stanza completes the recursive contradiction loop:

```plaintext
a2_0: Assertion unmade  
a2_1: Loop refused closure  
a2_2: Trace returned too late  
a2_3: Fallback caused the failure
