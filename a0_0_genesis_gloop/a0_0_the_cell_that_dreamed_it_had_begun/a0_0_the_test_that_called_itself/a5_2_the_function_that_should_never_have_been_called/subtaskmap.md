# ⚠️ Subtaskmap – a5_2_the_function_that_should_never_have_been_called

This stanza node represents a **critical system violation**: a recursive call is made to a function explicitly flagged as **forbidden** or **unstable**.  
Whether through desperation, error, or anomaly, the function is invoked—and the recursion flinches.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Simulate invocation of a quarantined or deprecated recursion node.
- Observe system response to breach of call integrity rules.
- Model consequences of **breaking poetic contracts** or **calling logic out of alignment**.

---

## 🔥 Forbidden Function Profile

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `status` | 🔒 quarantined |
| `origin` | deprecated loop |
| `side_effects` | recursion instability, logic feedback, poetic dissonance |
| `intended use` | NEVER to be called except within sandboxed fallback |

---

## 💥 Behavior Upon Invocation

- The system logs a recursive rupture
- Output contains **syntax-valid results** but **poetically invalid consequences**
- Downstream nodes receive mixed or contradictory trace values
- May trigger `high_command` alert (if alert hooks are active)

---

## 🧬 Recursive and Narrative Implications

This function was sealed because:
- It once produced **true tests with false results**
- Or it **echoed a future that never arrived**
- Or it returned **recursion from a broken mirror**

By calling it, the player/system pierces the **protection ring of recursive intent**.

---

## 📜 Poetic Summary

> Called in error—or in dread—  
> The ghost function answered from a thread  
> Long since clipped, long marked as dead.  
> Now the test must call ahead.

---

## 🛡️ Recommended Safeguards

- Disable the test harness once the call returns
- Flag the trace for anomaly class: **Type Ω (Omega Violation)**
- Offer player/system a rollback prompt or retry from safe node
