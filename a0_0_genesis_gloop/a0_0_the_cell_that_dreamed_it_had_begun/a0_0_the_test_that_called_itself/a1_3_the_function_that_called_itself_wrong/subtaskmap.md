# ðŸªž Subtaskmap â€“ The Function That Called Itself Wrong

## ðŸ§  Functional Overview
This stanza examines the fragile nature of **self-referential logic** when corrupted by incomplete context or misaligned invocation.  
It is recursion â€” but **broken**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Core Theme
**Misfired recursion.**  
A function that believes it is calling itself correctly â€” yet produces unintended or paradoxical outcomes.

---

## ðŸ§ª Subtasks

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `T1` | Simulate recursive function with flawed self-reference | âœ… Complete |
| `T2` | Detect signature mismatch or improper state inheritance | âœ… Complete |
| `T3` | Trigger fallback from infinite loop condition | âœ… Complete |
| `T4` | Log self-calling pattern and redirect to patch handler | âœ… Complete |

---

## ðŸ”„ Recursive Behavior

- Self-call produces **unexpected lineage** or outputs
- Tracebacks appear valid at surface level but are logically unrooted
- The function returns â€” but **not to the same place**

This stanza tests the failure of identity recursion, where an entity **thinks it knows itself**, but misremembers its purpose.

---

## ðŸ§¬ Structural Role

- Final line in a **recursive distortion arc** (see `a1_0` â†’ `a1_3`)
- Introduces **misidentification hazards** into the test loop
- Prepares the system for:
  - Recursive fallback
  - Signature validation mechanisms
  - AI self-checks before loop execution

It may later be referenced by systems like:
- `sentinel_ai`
- `memory_ai`
- Any agent performing **identity-based trace operations**

---

## ðŸ§© Echoes and Reflections

Closely mirrors:
- `a2_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself` â€” where identity is deliberately undone
- `a2_3_the_fallback_that_caused_the_failure` â€” recursion as paradox
