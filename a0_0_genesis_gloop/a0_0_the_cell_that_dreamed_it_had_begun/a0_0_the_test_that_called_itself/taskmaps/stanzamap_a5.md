# 🧩 Stanzamap – s5  
*The Final Collapse of Testing*

---

## 📜 Purpose  
This file indexes the **sixth stanza** in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`  
It marks the terminal phase of recursion — where all safeguards fail, recovery is misled, forbidden paths are taken, and the system answers too late.

This stanza is not about resilience. It is about recursion’s failure to contain itself.

## 📂 Stanza Lines

| Line  | Folder Name                                       | Status     | Summary                                                                 |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a5_0  | `a5_0_the_fallback_that_failed`                    | ✅ Passed   | A fallback mechanism activates — but fails catastrophically.            |
| a5_1  | `a5_1_the_trace_that_betrayed_the_test`            | ✅ Passed   | The system trusts a corrupted trace — and draws false conclusions.      |
| a5_2  | `a5_2_the_function_that_should_never_have_been_called` | ✅ Passed   | A forbidden recursive call is made, violating logic integrity.          |
| a5_3  | `a5_3_the_system_that_called_too_late`             | ✅ Passed   | Recovery is triggered, but all useful context is already lost.          |

## 🧠 Observations

- All nodes completed execution, but none offer genuine resolution.
- The stanza is a **systemic breakdown** — from fallback to false trust to forbidden recursion to delayed action.
- This is the **terminal phase** of the minigame’s recursion loop, after which no further self-test is possible without external repair.

## 🔁 Logic Commentary

Each stanza line echoes a breakdown pattern established earlier —  
but now **irreversible**.

> What once caught the fall now causes it.  
> What once verified now lies.  
> What once was logic now is void.

## ✅ Status: Complete  
Stanza `s5` has executed all four recursive nodes and marks the end of the minigame’s self-validation arc.
