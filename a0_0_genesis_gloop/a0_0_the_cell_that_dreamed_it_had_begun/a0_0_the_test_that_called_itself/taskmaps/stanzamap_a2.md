# 🧩 Stanzamap – s2  
*The Third Recursive Stanza: Echoes of Collapse*

---

## 📜 Purpose  
This file indexes the **third stanza** in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`  
It documents recursive failures, delayed signals, paradoxical fallbacks, and logical loops that defy closure.

## 📂 Stanza Lines

| Line | Folder Name                                 | Status     | Summary                                                           |
|------|----------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s2_0 | `a2_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself`      | ✅ Passed   | Recursion contradicts its own base case. Truth collapses inward. |
| s2_1 | `a2_1_the_loop_that_refused_to_close`        | ✅ Passed   | Loop spins forward but never resolves. Closure withheld.          |
| s2_2 | `a2_2_the_trace_that_returned_too_late`      | ✅ Passed   | Signal returns after context has faded. Delay invalidates truth.  |
| s2_3 | `a2_3_the_fallback_that_caused_the_failure`  | ✅ Passed   | Protective fallback misfires, becoming the trigger for failure.   |

## 🧠 Observations

- All lines passed their tests, but each models a unique form of **recursive fragility**.
- The stanza explores:
  - Assertions that unravel themselves
  - Loops that resist finality
  - Traces that miss their moment
  - Fail-safes that fail their purpose
- Each mechanism reflects the **cost of recursion without coherence**.

---

## 🌀 Fallbacks & Forward Paths

- No fallback paths were needed — paradoxes resolved internally.  
- The stanza completes a dark mirror of the first stanza:  
  **The test undoes itself. The truths collapse. The fail-safes fail.**

---

## ✅ Status: Complete  
All four stanza lines passed. Stanza `s2` is sealed.
