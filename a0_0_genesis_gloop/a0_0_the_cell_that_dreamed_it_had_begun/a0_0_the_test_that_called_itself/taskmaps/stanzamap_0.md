# 📘 Stanza Map – 0 – The First Recursion Line  
*A stanza of emergence, testing, and fallback*

---

## 📜 Overview

This stanza begins the **first recursive loop** within the minigame `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`.  
It introduces a four-part recursive logic structure that tests:

- Initial contact
- Looping conditions
- Trace integrity
- Emergency fallback paths

Each stanza line is a self-contained **Y-node** in the recursive world of Primordial Soup, with a `main.py` logic module and a `test.py` validator.

## 🔁 Node Structure

| Line | Folder | Title | Summary |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `a0_0` | `a0_0_the_assertion_of_first_contact` | First input check | Establishes signal recognition and invocation. |
| `a0_1` | `a0_1_the_loop_that_tested_closure` | Loop entry + repeat logic | Tests for closure or infinite looping conditions. |
| `a0_2` | `a0_2_the_trace_that_returned_wrong` | Data integrity validator | Checks return path and signal trace accuracy. |
| `a0_3` | `a0_3_the_fallback_that_caught_the_signal` | Fail-safe reentry | Catches failed logic and routes to safe recovery. |

---

## 🧪 Expected Behavior

- All nodes can be entered manually or programmatically via `test.py`.
- Each node simulates battlefield decisions (`L`, `R`, `Escape`) or internal logic tests.
- If a node **fails**, fallback behavior is:
  - Either handled internally (e.g. `a0_3`)
  - Or returned as a failure report (`❌` logic response).

---

## 🧠 Fallback Logic

- `a0_3` acts as the safety catch for upstream failures.
- Test scripts may simulate fallbacks to `a0_3` if:
  - `main.py` is missing,
  - `evaluate()` returns a broken state,
  - `test.py` encounters unexpected inputs.

## 🔍 Poetic Commentary

> The test called out, and something answered.  
> A loop was drawn, and then unspooled.  
> A trace came back, but changed in form.  
> A hand reached out, and caught the fall.

## 🔗 Forward Hook

Next stanza begins with:  
`📁 a1_0_the_checkpoint_that_missed_the_mark`  
Which moves from emergence to **diagnosis and deeper pattern recognition**.

---

## ✅ Status

All nodes in this stanza have:
- `main.py` and `test.py` implemented,
- Passed functional logic tests (5/5 where applicable),
- Participated in the recursive structure of the minigame.

This stanza is now marked **COMPLETE**.
