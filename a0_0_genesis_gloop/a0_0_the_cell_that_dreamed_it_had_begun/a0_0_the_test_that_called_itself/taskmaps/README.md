# ðŸ“˜ Taskmap README â€“ a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself

This folder contains the stanza-level task documentation for the minigame `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`.  
It was the **first minigame** in the first cybercell of *Primordial Soup*, built to validate recursive gameplay mechanics, fallback resolution, and test/trace loop integrity.

## ðŸ“š Folder Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `taskmap.md` | Master index of stanza lines (Layer 4 folders) and their linked tasks |
| `stanzamap_s0.md` | Maps the poetic and structural logic of the first stanza |
| `milestones.md` | Tracks development milestones, playability status, and recursion results |
| `README.md` | Explains this folderâ€™s function and its importance within the broader cybercell |
| *(future)* `stanzamap_s1.md`, etc. | Will be added as new stanzas are layered or extended |

## ðŸ§¬ Purpose of This Taskmap

The purpose of this taskmap is to:

- Document each stanza line's **task binding** and **recursive function**
- Serve as a blueprint for how recursion is encoded and tested
- Provide development state visibility as the stanza matures
- Track recursive anomaly outcomes or transitions between play/test states

---

## ðŸ§  Recursive Context

This taskmap sits inside the first cybercell (`a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun`),  
which contains this stanza (`a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`) as its **1A seed** â€” the origin point of all recursive play.

The logic and structure defined here will become the recursive reference for all future stanza-based minigames.
