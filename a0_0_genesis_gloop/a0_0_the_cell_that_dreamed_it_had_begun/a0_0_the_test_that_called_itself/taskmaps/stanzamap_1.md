# 🧩 Stanzamap – 1  
*Checkpoint Recursions and Forgotten Flags*

---

## 📜 Purpose  
This file indexes the **second stanza** in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`  
It tracks stanza line logic, test results, poetic framing, and recursive flow behavior.

## 📂 Stanza Lines

| Line | Folder Name                                 | Status     | Summary                                                      |
|------|----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| a1_0 | `a1_0_the_checkpoint_that_missed_the_mark`   | ✅ Passed   | Validates signal readiness. Fails on missing or malformed keys. |
| a1_1 | `a1_1_the_logfile_that_forgot_its_past`      | ✅ Passed   | Parses memory trails. Recovers from gaps and silent entries. |
| a1_2 | `a1_2_the_flag_that_was_raised_too_early`    | ✅ Passed   | Verifies flag timing. Detects premature or uninitialized triggers. |
| a1_3 | `a1_3_the_function_that_called_itself_wrong` | ✅ Passed   | Probes recursive anomalies. Logs trails of self-misreference. |

---

## 🧠 Observations

- All nodes passed cleanly, with no fallback invoked.
- This stanza focuses on **fragile triggers**, **temporal misalignments**, and **recursive instability**.
- It offers insight into:
  - Signal integrity at the edge of readiness
  - Memory parsing across initialization gaps
  - Self-referential logic under stress

---

## 🌀 Fallbacks & Forward Paths

No explicit fallbacks or portal branches were invoked within stanza `a1`.  
It likely hands off to the **next recursion stanza** or transitions control to the **minigame spine**.

---

## ✅ Status: Complete  
Stanza `a1` has been fully tested and validated. All logic paths resolved without error.
