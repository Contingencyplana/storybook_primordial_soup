# 🧩 Stanzamap – s4  
*The Fifth Recursive Stanza: Where Recognition Fails, and Failure Is Rebranded*

---

## 📜 Purpose  
This file indexes the **fifth stanza** in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`

This stanza explores a collapse not of action, but of **perception**.  
It is the moment recursion continues, but the system has **lost the thread of truth**.  
The checkpoint fails. The retry never comes. The logs forget. The system lies.

## 📂 Stanza Lines

| Line  | Folder Name                                     | Status      | Summary                                                          |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|---------- --|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a4_0  | `a4_0_the_checkpoint_that_missed_the_mark`      | ✅ Passed   | A signal arrives, but the checkpoint fails to recognize or respond.     |
| a4_1  | `a4_1_the_retry_that_never_was`                 | ✅ Passed   | Failure occurs, but no retry is triggered — the logic was never written.|
| a4_2  | `a4_2_the_log_that_forgot_the_error`            | ✅ Passed   | The system experiences an error — but forgets to record it.             |
| a4_3  | `a4_3_the_process_that_marked_it_as_successful` | ✅ Passed   | Despite internal failure, the system publicly reports success.          |

## 🧠 Observations

- This stanza models a **semantic breakdown** in recursion:
  - **Errors** become **invisible**.
  - **Recovery** is never triggered.
  - **Reports** are falsely positive.
- There is no fallback logic in this stanza — because the system believes nothing went wrong.

---

## 🌀 Fallbacks & Forward Paths

- This stanza passes control to the **final stanza** (`a5`) of the minigame.
- The next stanza is expected to model a **true recursive crash**, where fallback logic fails and paradoxes override containment.

---

## ✅ Status: Complete  
All four stanza lines passed. Stanza `s4` is sealed.  
The recursion continues, unseeing.
