# 📍 Milestones – a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself

This file tracks the developmental and recursive milestones reached by the minigame `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`.  
As the very first stanza of the first cybercell, it serves as a testbed for recursive gameplay logic, structure validation, and fallback protocols.

---

## ✅ Core Milestones

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `M0.1` | Stanza folder created and initialized | ✅ Complete |
| `M0.2` | `main.py` implemented and validated | ✅ Complete |
| `M0.3` | `test.py` constructed and passes basic test | ✅ Complete |
| `M0.4` | `subtaskmap.md` created and describes poetic/technical logic | ✅ Complete |
| `M0.5` | Full stanza tested through play | ✅ Complete |
| `M0.6` | Anomaly check completed post-minigame | ✅ Complete (No anomaly found) |
| `M0.7` | Stanza listed in `cybercell_roadmap.md` as complete | ✅ Confirmed |
| `M0.8` | Serves as recursive reference pattern for future stanzas | 🟡 Inferred, not yet cross-referenced |

## 🧪 Observations

- This stanza established the **playable minigame loop** at Layer 4.
- It validated the **first successful fallback and trace return test.**
- It closed with a clean `"RECURSION CLOSED"` state — an intentional design lock to ensure recursion completeness.

---

## 🔁 Recursion Outcome

**Recursion Status**: ✅ Closed  
**Fallback Activated**: ✅ Yes  
**Trace Completed**: ✅ Yes  
**Next Action**: Proceed to next stanza in Layer 3 (`a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom`)
