# 🧩 Stanzamap – 3  
*The Collapse of Recursion: A Stanza of Self-Undoing and Failed Defenses*

---

## 📜 Purpose  
This file indexes the **fourth stanza** in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`

This stanza explores the moment recursion **fails to hold itself together**.  
Assertions collapse. Loops drift. Traces arrive too late.  
And the fallbacks — built to protect — become the final cause of system failure.

## 📂 Stanza Lines

| Line  | Folder Name                                     | Status     | Summary                                                                 |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a3_0  | `a3_0_the_assertion_that_unmade_itself`         | ✅ Passed   | A self-negating input collapses its own logic. The assertion undoes itself. |
| a3_1  | `a3_1_the_loop_that_refused_to_close`           | ✅ Passed   | The loop identifies completion but continues endlessly. No closure allowed. |
| a3_2  | `a3_2_the_trace_that_returned_too_late`         | ✅ Passed   | The trace returns after the timeout — its meaning lost in delay.          |
| a3_3  | `a3_3_the_fallback_that_caused_the_failure`     | ✅ Passed   | The fallback logic misfires and causes the failure it was built to prevent. |

## 🧠 Observations

- Every line models a form of recursive disintegration:
  - Contradictions,
  - Non-termination,
  - Temporal drift,
  - Defensive collapse
- Collectively, they simulate a system **looping past the point of logic**.
- No fallbacks were invoked — because the stanza **is the fallback** — and it failed.

---

## 🌀 Fallbacks & Forward Paths

- This stanza ends the **first full recursion cycle** in `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`.
- The next stanza (`a4`) will likely explore the **diagnostics, silence, or attempts to rebuild** from failure.

---

## ✅ Status: Complete  
All four stanza lines passed. Stanza `a3` is sealed.  
This concludes the stanza of recursive collapse.
