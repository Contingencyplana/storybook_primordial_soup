# 🧭 Subtaskmap – The Checkpoint That Missed the Mark

## 🧠 Functional Overview
This node explores what happens when a system checkpoint is triggered **at the wrong moment** — too early, too late, or misaligned with actual recursion flow. It tests the assumption that stateful checkpoints can reliably capture progress in a recursive system.

---

## 📌 Core Theme
**Failure of premature validation.**  
The checkpoint exists — but the recursion hasn't matured enough for it to make sense.

---

## 🧪 Subtasks

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `T1` | Simulate early checkpoint trigger | ✅ Complete |
| `T2` | Detect absence of required recursion state | ✅ Complete |
| `T3` | Fallback response to invalid checkpoint | ✅ Complete |
| `T4` | Log recursive misfire and reset cycle | ✅ Complete |

---

## 🌀 Recursive Behavior
If the checkpoint is fired:
- Before proper conditions are met → triggers an **error state**.
- Without context → may **erase** or **forget** previous recursion paths.
- With incorrect flags → redirects to fallback routines.

---

## 🔁 Lessons for Future Stanzas
- **Checkpoints must follow the recursion, not precede it.**
- Validation logic should evolve in tandem with recursive intelligence.
- Premature certainty leads to self-nullification.

## 🧬 Structural Role
This stanza helped **invalidate false positives** in system state validation. It forms part of the **first recursive contradiction loop**, alongside `a1_1` through `a1_3`.

It also echoes the later stanza line:  
🧪 `a2_1_the_loop_that_refused_to_close`

Both represent different facets of **recursion rejected**.
