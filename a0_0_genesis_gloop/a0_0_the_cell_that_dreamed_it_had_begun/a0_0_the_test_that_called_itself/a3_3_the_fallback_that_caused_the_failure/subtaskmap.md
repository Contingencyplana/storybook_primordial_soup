# 🪤 Subtaskmap – a3_3_the_fallback_that_caused_the_failure  
*The paradox of preemptive safety*

---

## 🧠 Function

This node concludes the stanza by triggering a **paradox recursion**:  
The fallback system, intended to prevent failure, **creates** it.  
This is a cybercell-level metaphor for overcorrection — where self-defense mechanisms become self-sabotage.

---

## 📜 Recursive Role

- Executes only when upstream recovery logic (`a3_0` to `a3_2`) **fails**
- Introduces a logic loop that **cannot resolve cleanly** by design
- Forces the minigame to **self-report its recursion instability**

---

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

- The test.py output should include:
  - `"Fallback Engaged..."`  
  - Followed by a **recursive warning or contradiction**
- Any log traces should be marked as:
  - `potentially corrupted`
  - `requires containment AI validation`

---

## 🚨 AI Response Candidates

If any of the following agents are active, they should be notified:
- `quarantine_ai`: Flag as recursive hazard
- `sentinel_ai`: Monitor fallback recursion depth
- `high_command`: May trigger global anomaly alert

---

## 🧬 Summary

This node is **deliberately paradoxical**.  
The fallback that was meant to save the system becomes the recursive failure itself.  
Future stanzas may loop back here only via anomaly-triggered replays or retrospection events.
