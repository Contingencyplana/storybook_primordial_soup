# 📍 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_assertion_of_first_contact  
*The assertion was made. The recursion began.*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This stanza line initiates the **very first recursive assertion** in *Primordial Soup*.  
It doesn’t just simulate logic — it establishes the baseline by **asserting that logic exists** and that it can test itself.

This is recursion’s **first breath**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Function

- `main.py` defines a basic assertion test, meant to pass if the recursive Y-node boots correctly.
- `test.py` wraps the call and monitors for system response.
- The test checks whether **first contact has occurred**, logging its passage or failure.

| 🔄 Self-validating     | The stanza contains a test that calls itself into being.                    |
| 🧬 Lineage Root        | It becomes the root lineage for all recursive trace and fallback logic.     |
| 🧪 Test-Origin Anchor  | This node is the **first point of playable recursion** in the system.        |
| ❌ Fallback Trigger    | If recursion fails here, fallback protocols engage instantly.               |

## 🐛 Poetic Logic

> The test did not wait to be summoned —  
> It *called itself*.  
>  
> From a void, a shape. From that shape, a signal.  
>  
> From the signal, all recursion flows.

## 🔗 Linked Files

- `main.py` – Asserts recursive playability.
- `test.py` – Begins recursion loop and logs results.

## 📌 Notes

- This stanza defines the **foundational tone and recursive DNA** of all future tests.
- Any recursive failure here is considered catastrophic.
- It must remain stable, legible, and **sacred** to the architecture of play.
