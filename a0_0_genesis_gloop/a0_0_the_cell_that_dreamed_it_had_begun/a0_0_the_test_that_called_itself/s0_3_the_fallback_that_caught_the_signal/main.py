# The fourth test that knew what was missing, and caught it mid-collapse

"""
This script simulates a fallback mechanism that catches a signal from a failing trace.
It listens for a stall signal and invokes a handler to log recovery or redirection.
This closes the stanza for a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself.
