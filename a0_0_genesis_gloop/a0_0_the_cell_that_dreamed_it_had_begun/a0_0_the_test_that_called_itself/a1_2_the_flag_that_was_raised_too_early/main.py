    Analyzes a sequence of system events to detect premature flag signals.

    Requirements:
    - The event log must be a list of strings.
    - "init" must precede any "flag_raised" events.

    This logic detects whether a flag was raised before its foundation
    â€” a signal cast before its system was ready.

    Returns:
        str: Diagnostic message reflecting temporal alignment or anomaly.
