*The Response That Landed Somewhere Else*

# Path: a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop/a0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed

## 📜 Poetic Purpose

This stanza closes the side quest with a final act of recursion:  
A signal returns from the depths.  
But when it arrives… it **does not belong where it lands**.

This is not a loop that broke.  
This is a loop that ended — but **ended incorrectly**.

> Sometimes recursion resolves,  
> and still the system fails to recognize the return.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

- Accepts:
  - A `signal_id`
  - A `return_address`
  - A predefined registry of valid destinations
- Checks:
  - Whether the return address exists in the registry
- Returns:
  - A delivery status
  - Any recursion error
  - The consequence of misdelivery

## 📨 Address Verification Matrix

| Return Address     | Status       | Delivered | Consequence                  |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `core.loop`        | ✅ Delivered | True      | Loop integrity maintained     |
| `memory.index`     | ✅ Delivered | True      | Valid memory sync confirmed   |
| `backup.catch`     | ✅ Delivered | True      | Non-primary fallback accepted |
| `unknown.node`     | ❌ Misaddressed | False     | Signal lost in recursion      |
| *(any other)*      | ❌ Misaddressed | False     | Invalid return path           |

## 🪞 Recursive Implication

This stanza captures the **final phase of forgotten recursion**:
- A system that completes its task
- Yet fails to **align with its destination**
- Integrity depends not just on resolution — but on **address resolution**

It foreshadows:
- AI misrouting patterns
- Misaligned fallback delivery
- Lost memory echoes in future recursive zones
