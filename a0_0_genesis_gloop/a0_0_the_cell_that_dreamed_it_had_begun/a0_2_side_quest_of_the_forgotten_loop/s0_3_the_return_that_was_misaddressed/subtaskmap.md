# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed

## 🌀 Poetic Function

This node simulates the moment a system calls out — but mislabels the destination.

> It packaged its truth,  
> stamped it with urgency,

>  
> But the address was wrong,  
> and the dark never answered.

It reflects recursive decay not through silence, but through **miscommunication**: the system believes it completed the exchange, but the return value goes nowhere meaningful.

## 🛠️ Technical Function

### Function: `validate_return_routing(return_value, recipient_registry, recipient_id)`

#### Purpose:
Tests whether a return signal was delivered to a valid recipient.

#### Behavior:
- If `recipient_id` exists in the `recipient_registry`, return is acknowledged (`True`)
- If `recipient_id` is missing, return is **misaddressed** (`False`)
- Output is printed to track delivery path or failure

## 🔬 Test Cases

| Test # | Return Value | Recipient Registry              | Recipient ID | Expected | Outcome Description          |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 1      | `"OK"`        | `{"alpha": "Subsystem A"}`      | `"alpha"`    | ✅ True  | Successful return routing    |
| 2      | `"42"`        | `{"alpha": "Subsystem A"}`      | `"gamma"`    | ❌ False | Recipient not found          |
| 3      | `None`        | `{"x": "Memory Module"}`        | `"x"`        | ✅ True  | Null return but valid target |
| 4      | `"alert"`     | `{}`                            | `"admin"`    | ❌ False | Empty registry               |

## 🔁 Recursive Implications

- This node models **logical detachment** — where signals *exist* but land in voids
- Lays groundwork for:
  - `sentinel_ai`: escalation based on signal drift
  - `memory_ai`: tracing vanished outcomes
  - recovery stanzas: return re-routing and delayed acknowledgements

---

## 🧬 Stanza Closure Logic

This node caps the stanza by expressing the **final phase of recursive decay**:
- The loop was unclosed (`s0_0`)
- The trace lost itself (`s0_1`)
- The flag went unseen (`s0_2`)
- And now the answer… is sent to no one.
