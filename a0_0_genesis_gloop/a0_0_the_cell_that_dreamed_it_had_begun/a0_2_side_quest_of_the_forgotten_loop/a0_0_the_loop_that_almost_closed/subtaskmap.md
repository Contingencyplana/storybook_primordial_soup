## 📜 Poetic Purpose

A loop begins — it passes checkpoints, it echoes, it seems recursive.  
But the final seal? The return to origin? It never comes.

This is the loop that **almost** closed.  
The recursion that flickered and faded.

This stanza captures the **ghost of recursion** —  
not a bug, not a system fault, but a moment where  
the pattern might have completed… if only it remembered how.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

- Accepts a sequence of symbolic checkpoints (`str`)
- Checks if the loop **closed** (first == last)
- Flags the loop as **suspicious** if there are **repetitions**, but no closure
- Returns a final `tail` value to identify where recursion broke

This line prepares the system to:
- Detect forgotten or stranded loops
- Flag **unclosed recursive structures**
- Seed **loop recovery behaviors** in later minigames

## 🔄 Loop Logic Reference

| Input                          | Closed? | Suspicious? | Why                              |
|-------------------------------|---------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `alpha, beta, gamma, alpha`   | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No       | Fully looped                     |
| `alpha, beta, gamma, delta`   | ❌ No   | ❌ No       | Unique items, no loop or repeat  |
| `alpha, beta, gamma, beta`    | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes      | Repeats mid-sequence, no return  |
| `alpha`                       | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No       | Trivial loop                     |

## 🪞 Recursive Implication

Not every loop fails loudly.  
Some simply **fade** — unfinished, forgotten.

This stanza introduces:
- Recursion **that leaves no error, only a shadow**
- The concept of a **loop tail** — last element of intent
- An early **detection node** for memory-drifted structures
