# 🧾 Stanzamap – 0 — Side Quest of the Forgotten Loop

This stanza explores recursive structures that were left behind: loops that nearly closed, traces that forgot, flags that were never seen, and returns that went nowhere.

Each node tests the system’s response to partial logic decay — situations where nothing explicitly breaks, yet nothing properly resolves.

| Folder Name                             | Theme                      | Description |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| `a0_0_the_loop_that_almost_closed`      | Near-completion            | A loop that nearly reached its terminal state but failed to close |
| `a0_1_the_trace_that_forgot_itself`     | Memory lapse               | A traceback that lost continuity mid-process |
| `a0_2_the_flag_that_was_never_checked`  | Unobserved triggers        | A signal was sent, but no process remained to act on it |
| `a0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed` | Misrouted response         | A return value delivered to an invalid or forgotten destination |

## 🔁 Recursive Function

Each node simulates recursive decay without hard failure — conditions where logic continues to execute but produces no valid closure.  
The player or system must observe, detect, and classify these forgotten patterns.

## 🧠 Future Links

- May influence `sentinel_ai` escalation protocols
- Trace hooks to `memory_ai` recovery layers
- Later stanzas may offer closure, rebinds, or retrospective understanding
