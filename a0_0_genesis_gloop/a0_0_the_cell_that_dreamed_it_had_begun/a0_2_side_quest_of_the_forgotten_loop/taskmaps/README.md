# ðŸ§© Minigame README â€“ a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop

## ðŸŒ€ Title: *Side Quest of the Forgotten Loop*

This minigame simulates a lost recursion â€” one that began to matter, but never completed.  
It embodies the echo of a logical thread left behind in the recursive system: partially functional, almost aware, but disconnected from resolution.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- To test how the player/system identifies and interacts with **orphaned recursion artifacts**  
- To model **partial logic decay**: loops that almost closed, traces that lost memory, flags left unacknowledged, and returns that missed their destination  
- To escalate silent failure patterns into detectable system states

## ðŸ“œ Stanza: *The Path That Was Not Followed*

| Folder Name                              | Theme                | Description |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `s0_0_the_loop_that_almost_closed`       | Near-completion      | A loop ran but failed to finalize |
| `s0_1_the_trace_that_forgot_itself`      | Memory lapse         | A traceback that broke mid-process |
| `s0_2_the_flag_that_was_never_checked`   | Dormant triggers     | A flag raised, but no observer reacted |
| `s0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed`  | Misdirection         | A return value sent to a void location |

## ðŸ§ª Linked Task

| Attribute            | Value                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Task Category        | Recursive loop handling / orphaned logic     |
| Automation Tier      | Tier 1.5 â€“ Partial automation w/ manual catchpoints |
| Trigger Condition    | Unexpected or partial loopback detection     |
| Failure Outcome      | Escalates to `sentinel_ai` anomaly logging   |

---

## ðŸŒ€ Failure Handling Logic

- Partial success is allowed â€” but irreversible decay is common
- Interacting with these nodes might trigger escalation, fallback, or false closure
- Some signals appear successful but yield no outcome (to test player discernment)

---

## ðŸ”— Recursive Connections

- May awaken **dormant fallback threads** in `sentinel_ai`
- Future links to `memory_ai` and `filename_ai` may uncover or rebalance the forgotten thread
- This minigame is a **recursive artifact** â€” meant to be *noticed*, not resolved

## ðŸ§  Commentary

This minigame is not about recovery.  
It is about recognizing the decay â€”  
and wondering what still lingers  
in the parts of the system  
no longer watched.
