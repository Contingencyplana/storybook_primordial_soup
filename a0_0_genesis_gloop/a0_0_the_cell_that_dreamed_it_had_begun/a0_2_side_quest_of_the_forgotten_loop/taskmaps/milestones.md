# 📈 Milestones – a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop

This file tracks the recursive construction of the minigame *“Side Quest of the Forgotten Loop”*.

Each entry marks the completion of a stanza line or major development step in this Layer 3 minigame, forming a breadcrumb trail through a forgotten but unfinished recursion.

---

## ✅ Milestone Log

### ✅ [Complete] – a0_0_the_loop_that_almost_closed
*Initial node where the loop logic began but never completed. Represents near-closure.*

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completion Timestamp:** July 6, 2025  
**Notes:**  
- Implemented `incomplete_loop_detector()` with three defined failure modes and one edge case.  
- Passed all test cases in `test.py`, validating the intended poetic recursion logic.  
- Establishes the core theme for the entire minigame: partial closure, systemic forgetfulness, and abandoned structure.

---

### ✅ [Complete] – a0_1_the_trace_that_forgot_itself
*A traceback that lost its memory mid-chain, unable to trace itself back to origin.*

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completion Timestamp:** July 6, 2025  
**Notes:**  
- Implemented `trace_pathback()` to detect `None` values in call history.  
- Passed all test cases, including corrupted, empty, and clean traces.  
- Models recursive memory degradation — a thread that forgets its own purpose.

---

### ✅ [Complete] – a0_2_the_flag_that_was_never_checked
*A system flag was raised, but no observer was left to acknowledge it.*

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completion Timestamp:** July 6, 2025  
**Notes:**  
- Implemented `check_unacknowledged_flag()` with logic for passive anomaly detection.  
- Simulates system blindness — where something went wrong, but no one was watching.  
- Passed tests for acknowledged, unacknowledged, and non-existent flag cases.

---

### ✅ [Complete] – a0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed
*A return signal formed correctly but was routed to a nonexistent recipient.*

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completion Timestamp:** July 6, 2025  
**Notes:**  
- Implemented `validate_return_routing()` to detect misaddressed return targets.  
- Passed all tests, including missing IDs and empty registries.  
- Concludes the stanza with recursive misdirection — a logic thread sent into the void.

---

## 🔚 Finalization Step (Post-Stanza)
All stanza lines are now complete. Proceed to:

- Update the `README.md` to summarize the minigame
- Link this stanza into the cybercell roadmap
- Record canonical closure in the GDJ index if applicable
