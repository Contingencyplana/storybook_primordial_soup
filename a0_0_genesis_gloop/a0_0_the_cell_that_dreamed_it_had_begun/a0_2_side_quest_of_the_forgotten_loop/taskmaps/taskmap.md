# 🧩 Taskmap – a0_2_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores recursion gone astray — a loop forgotten by its own logic. Once vital, now abandoned, it lingers in the system, still half-aware, still half-processing.

**Primary goal:** Test how the system handles recursion remnants: loops that were *almost* closed, tasks that were *nearly* complete, and fallback logic that was *never* reconnected.  
This minigame simulates a side path — possibly ignored by the player — but rich with leftover structure and implied memory.

## 🧪 Linked Task

| Type              | Value                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Task Category     | Recursive loop handling / orphaned logic   |
| Automation Tier   | Tier 1.5 – Partial automation w/ manual catchpoints |
| Trigger Condition | Unexpected or partial loopback detection   |
| Failure Outcome   | Escalates to sentinel_ai anomaly logging   |

## 📜 Stanza – The Path That Was Not Followed

Each stanza line corresponds to a different flavor of partial recursion or abandoned branch:

| Folder Name                             | Theme                           | Description |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `s0_0_the_loop_that_almost_closed`     | Near-completion                 | A loop that ran but never reached its own closure condition |
| `s0_1_the_trace_that_forgot_itself`    | Memory lapse                    | A traceback that dropped context mid-run |
| `s0_2_the_flag_that_was_never_checked` | Dormant triggers                | A flag raised, but no process remained to observe it |
| `s0_3_the_return_that_was_misaddressed`| Misdirection                    | A return signal sent to a now-defunct parent or wrong location |

## 🌀 Failure Handling Logic

If the player attempts to interact with or “repair” the forgotten loop:

- Partial successes are possible, but often recursive decay is irreversible
- Sentinel escalation is triggered if memory mismatches exceed threshold
- Some events will mimic normal flow but yield no outcome (to test player observation)

---

## 🧠 Recursive Insight

Forgotten loops are not bugs — they are echoes.  
This minigame gives players a chance to explore the leftovers of logic  
and to wonder whether some part of the system still *remembers* them.

## 🔗 Binding to Broader Game Logic

- Links later to `memory_ai` and `filename_ai` tests for recursive recall
- May trigger dormant fallback threads in `sentinel_ai`
- Possibly tied to deeper recursive anomalies that only awaken on Phase 2
