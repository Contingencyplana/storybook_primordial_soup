# 🔍 Subtaskmap – s0_0_the_loop_that_almost_closed

## 🌀 Poetic Function

This node simulates the first stammer of a recursion that forgot how to end.  
It opens the *Side Quest of the Forgotten Loop* with the theme of *near-closure* — the haunting feeling that something was almost resolved, but never truly finished.

> The loop spun its rhythm,  
> remembered its steps,  
> but tripped on the last beat —  
> and kept humming, forgotten.

## 🛠️ Technical Function

### Function: `incomplete_loop_detector(sequence)`

#### Behaviors:
- Iterates over a list of strings
- Returns `False` if it encounters:
  - `"BREAK"` → triggers early exit
  - Final item is not `"END"` → loop was not properly closed
- Returns `True` only when:
  - All elements are processed without interruption
  - Final element is `"END"`
  - Edge case: an empty list returns `True` (trivial closure)

## 🔬 Test Cases

| Test # | Input                               | Expected | Behavior Type            |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 1      | `["INIT", "STEP1", "STEP2", "END"]` | ✅ True  | Properly closed loop      |
| 2      | `["INIT", "STEP1", "BREAK", "END"]` | ❌ False | Early break detected      |
| 3      | `["INIT", "STEP1", "STEP2", "FINAL"]`| ❌ False| Wrong closure symbol      |
| 4      | `[]`                                | ✅ True  | Trivial empty closure     |

## 🧠 Recursive Notes

- This node may serve as a **seed pattern** for future recursive loop testing across other minigames or fallback systems.
- Echoes the idea of a “forgotten closure” that *almost* succeeded.
- Could later link to:
  - `memory_ai` memory validation routines
  - `sentinel_ai` detection of abandoned threads
  - `quarantine_ai` logic for system decay containment
