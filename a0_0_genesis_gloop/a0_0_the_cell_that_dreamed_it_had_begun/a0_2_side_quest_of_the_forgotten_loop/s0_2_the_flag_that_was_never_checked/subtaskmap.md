# 🎯 Subtaskmap – s0_2_the_flag_that_was_never_checked

## 🌀 Poetic Function

This node simulates the sorrow of being noticed by no one.

> A flag was raised —  
> not to warn, but to whisper.  
> Yet no watcher turned,  
> and the silence stayed whole.

It captures a recursive system’s failure not through error, but through absence: a state was set, a signal flickered, and the system moved on without seeing.

## 🛠️ Technical Function

### Function: `check_unacknowledged_flag(flag_state, observers)`

#### Parameters:
- `flag_state`: `True` if a flag has been raised in the system.
- `observers`: a list of watchers or listening components that could acknowledge the flag.

#### Logic:
- If the flag is **raised** and `observers` is **empty** → anomaly detected → return `True`.
- If the flag is **raised** and **someone is watching** → return `False`.
- If the flag is **not raised**, return `False` regardless of observers.

## 🔬 Test Cases

| Test # | Input                                | Expected | Behavior Type           |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1      | `True`, `[]`                         | ✅ True  | Flag raised but unobserved (anomaly) |
| 2      | `True`, `["watcher1"]`               | ✅ False | Flag acknowledged        |
| 3      | `False`, `["watcher1", "watcher2"]`  | ✅ False | No flag raised           |
| 4      | `False`, `[]`                        | ✅ False | No flag raised, no observers |

## 🔁 Recursive Significance

- **This is a silent anomaly**: a fault that doesn't explode but echoes into the system.
- Can be used to **simulate passive decay**, **trigger fallback protocols**, or inform AI watchdog logic.
- May later link to:
  - `sentinel_ai`: flag-monitoring and escalation
  - `memory_ai`: tracing missed interactions
  - `quarantine_ai`: isolating patterns of unacknowledged behavior

---

## 🔍 Design Themes

- Builds upon:
  - `s0_0`: incomplete logic path
  - `s0_1`: corrupted traceback
- Adds the idea of **responsibility neglected**, not just failure or forgetfulness
