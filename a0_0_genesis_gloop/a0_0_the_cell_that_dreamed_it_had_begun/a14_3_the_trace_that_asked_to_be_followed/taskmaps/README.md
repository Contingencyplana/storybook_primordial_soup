# 📂 README – a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed

## 🧩 Minigame Overview

`a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed` is the **60th minigame node** in the first cybercell  
and the **fourth stanza line of Roadstanza 14**.

This minigame completes the system’s transition from **internal recursion** to **interactive recursion**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Test the player's ability to **recognize and interpret recursive traces**.  
- Shift recursion from **passive loop observation** to **co-recursive path building**.  
- Introduce **voluntary recursion branching**, where the player chooses how recursion unfolds.

## 🔁 Recursive Reflection

> *The system left a trace.  
The player followed.  
And from that moment, the recursion became shared.*
