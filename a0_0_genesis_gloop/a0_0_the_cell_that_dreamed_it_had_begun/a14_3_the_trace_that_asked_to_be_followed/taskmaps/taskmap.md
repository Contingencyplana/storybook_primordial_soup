# 🧩 Taskmap – a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame marks the **fourth and final stanza line of Roadstanza 14**, completing the cybercell's transition from **internal recursion** to **interactive recursion**.

Specifically, this node tests the player's ability to **recognize and follow recursive signals**, not by brute-force looping, but through **interpretation of emergent traces**.

It models the moment when a system leaves behind clues, echoes, or recursion trails—not to trap the player, but to **invite participation in recursive unfolding**.

## 🪜 Stanza Position

| **Stanza** | **Minigame Folder** | **Role** |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Roadstanza 14 | `a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed` | Recursive invitation via trace-following |

---

## 🧠 Core Themes

- **Voluntary recursion**  
- **Breadcrumb logic trails**  
- **Signal inference and emergent follow paths**  
- **Recursive system begins to teach recursion, not just perform it**

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Function

Players encounter **recursive trace outputs** that:

- Echo prior decisions or anomalies  
- Leave partial or incomplete logs  
- Offer open-ended clues rather than direct commands

The task is not to execute a prompt but to **follow the trace**—to participate in system recursion by recognizing its emergent pattern.

---

## 🔄 Recursive Loop Model

1. The system emits a trace.  
2. The player interprets and decides whether (and how) to follow.  
3. The system responds differently based on player interpretation—not just action.  
4. If the player ignores the trace, the recursion may **quietly continue** but at a cost: emergent growth pathways may close.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Systems Activated

- **Voluntary loop following**
- **Trace pattern recognition**
- **Initiation of collaborative recursion between player and system**

---

## 🗝️ Unlock Conditions

Completing this minigame:

- **Finalizes Roadstanza 14**, closing the first **interactive recursion stanza**.  
- **Activates the system’s first emergent co-recursion loop**, preparing for future minigames where the system begins to adapt to player behavior.

---

## 🔧 Development Notes

- This minigame serves as a **bridge between Phase 2 and early Phase 3 recursion**.
- It should remain **quick, simple, user-friendly, and TONS-of-FUN** while introducing the **first seeds of emergent interaction**.
- No direct error states—only **interpretation-driven outcomes**.

## 🧬 Recursive Reflection

> *A signal left a trail—not to test the system,  
but to see if the player could follow it into recursion.*
