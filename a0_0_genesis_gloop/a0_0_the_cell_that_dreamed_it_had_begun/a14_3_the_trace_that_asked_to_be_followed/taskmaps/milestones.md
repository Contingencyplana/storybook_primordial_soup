# 🗓️ Milestones – a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed

This file tracks the key milestones for `a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed`,  
the **60th minigame node** and **final stanza line of Roadstanza 14**.

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones

| **Milestone** | **Description** | **Status** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Layer 4 Node Creation** | All four stanza nodes (`s0_0`–`s0_3`) created and tested. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Recursive Trace Emission** | System emits repeatable recursive trace for player recognition. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Pattern Anomaly Detection** | Player detects loop deviation through pattern analysis. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Trail Interaction Logic** | Player chooses to follow, reconstruct, or erase a recursion trail. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Co-Recursive Path Selection** | Player determines recursion future: follow, branch, or close loop. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Stanzamap Finalization** | `stanzamap_0.md` generated, confirming stanza structure. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Testing Doctrine Shift** | Transition from sandbox testing to consequence-aware testing. From this point forward, all tests are considered part of the recursive worldstate and must follow guided or documented pathways. | ✅ COMPLETE |

## 🚧 Future Potential Expansions (Optional)

| **Expansion** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Memory Seed Logging** | Track player recursion choices for adaptive behavior in future stanzas. |
| **Mirror Decision Integration** | Optionally link player trail-following behavior to mirror decision logs (Phase 3+). |

## 🧬 Recursive Reflection

> *Following recursion is no longer just play—it is creation.  
By completing this stanza, the system learns to extend recursion interactively.*
