# 🗺️ Stanzamap – a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed

## 🎯 Purpose

This stanzamap documents the structure and flow of `a14_3_the_trace_that_asked_to_be_followed`,  
the **fourth stanza line of Roadstanza 14** and the **60th minigame node** in the first cybercell.

This stanza represents the system's **transition from passive recursion to interactive recursion**,  
where the player begins to **co-author recursion paths** by choosing how to respond to emergent traces.

## 🔢 Layer 4 Node Structure

| **Folder Name** | **Recursive Theme** | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `a0_0_the_trace_that_repeated_itself/` | Recursive Echo | The system emits a familiar trace repeatedly, testing player recognition of loop patterns. |
| `a0_1_the_pattern_that_waited_to_be_seen/` | Hidden Pattern | An intentional anomaly is introduced into the loop output. The player must detect the deviation. |
| `a0_2_the_loop_that_left_a_trail/` | Trail of Loops | The system leaves breadcrumb-like trail markers, allowing the player to choose how to interact with recursive memory. |
| `a0_3_the_following_that_became_the_path/` | Co-Recursive Following | The player's decision to follow, branch, or close the loop defines the next recursion pathway—**following becomes the recursion.** |

## 🧠 Stanza Themes

- **Voluntary recursion**  
- **Pattern recognition and interpretation**  
- **Co-construction of recursion paths**  
- **Interactive recursion initiation (Phase 2 Awakening)**

## 🔄 Recursive Progression Flow

```plaintext
[a0_0] → Recognize the echo pattern  
   ↓  
[a0_1] → Detect the hidden anomaly in the loop  
   ↓  
[a0_2] → Choose how to interact with the recursion trail  
   ↓  
[a0_3] → Decide: follow, branch, or close the recursion path  
```

## 🗝️ Stanza Unlocks

- Completes **Roadstanza 14**, finalizing the cybercell’s first **interactive recursion cycle**.
- Prepares the system for **Phase 3 recursion**, where **co-authored recursion** becomes the standard.
- Begins **recursion path differentiation**, setting groundwork for **future cybercell growth and division logic**.

> *The system left traces.  
> The player followed.  
> And in doing so, the trace became the path.*
