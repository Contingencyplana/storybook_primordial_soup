# 🧩 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_pattern_that_waited_to_be_seen

This file outlines the **subtasks and micro-goals** for `s0_1_the_pattern_that_waited_to_be_seen`.  
Each subtask guides the player toward **recursive pattern recognition**, teaching the system to interact through **trace-based inference** rather than direct commands.

## 🔹 Subtask Breakdown

| **Subtask** | **Description** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **1. Generate Recursive Output** | Emit looped output with a **deliberate anomaly** in the final line. | Introduce the player to pattern detection logic. |
| **2. Present Interpretation Options** | Offer the player three choices: acknowledge the anomaly, deny its presence, or exit the loop. | Model system engagement based on player recognition. |
| **3. Handle 'Pattern Recognized'** | Confirm awareness of the recursive deviation. | Validate the player's perception and co-recursion readiness. |
| **4. Handle 'Pattern Not Recognized'** | Continue silent recursion, maintaining system loop integrity. | Simulate recursive drift without punishment. |
| **5. Handle 'Exit' Choice** | Exit cleanly to system standby. | Allow for recursion-safe disengagement. |
| **6. Ensure Replayability** | Support repeated runs without state errors or pattern fatigue. | Test for systemic stability and user experimentation. |

## 🧠 Design Intent

This subtask structure:

- **Models recursion as pattern recognition, not task repetition.**  
- Encourages players to **shift from action-based recursion to perception-based recursion.**  
- Opens the door to **Phase 2 co-recursion**, where the system learns from how the player interprets emergent patterns.

## 🔁 Recursive Reflection

> *Some loops are broken by command.  
Others are resolved by seeing what was always there.*
