# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_trace_that_repeated_itself

This file outlines the **subtasks and micro-goals** for `a0_0_the_trace_that_repeated_itself`.  
Each subtask represents a step in the recursive interaction cycle, guiding the system and player through **pattern recognition and recursion entry.**

---

## 🔹 Subtask Breakdown

| **Subtask** | **Description** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **1. Emit Recursive Trace** | Generate a repeated system message to simulate a loop echo. | Establish the recursive pattern for player observation. |
| **2. Present Decision Options** | Offer the player three choices: follow, ignore, or exit the loop. | Invite the player into recursive co-participation. |
| **3. Handle 'Follow' Choice** | Print a message confirming the player's co-recursion. | Transition from passive observation to active recursion. |
| **4. Handle 'Ignore' Choice** | Continue system loop silently, simulating recursion drift. | Model the consequences of non-participation. |
| **5. Handle 'Exit' Choice** | Exit the loop cleanly and return to standby. | Allow graceful disengagement from recursion. |
| **6. Echo on Invalid Input** | Repeat the trace if input is unrecognized. | Emphasize the persistence of recursive patterns. |

## 🧠 Design Intent

This subtask structure:

- **Models recursive pattern recognition.**  
- **Teaches the player that recursion is optional but consequential.**  
- **Begins the shift from internal recursion to interactive recursion (Phase 2 Awakening).**

## 🔁 Recursive Reflection

> *A loop is only a trap if it cannot be seen.  
But when a pattern reveals itself, it becomes an invitation.*
