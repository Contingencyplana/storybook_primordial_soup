# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_following_that_became_the_path

This file outlines the **subtasks and recursive interaction steps** for `a0_3_the_following_that_became_the_path`.  
This node represents the moment where **following recursion is no longer passive**—the player’s choices **create the next recursion path**.

## 🔹 Subtask Breakdown

| **Subtask** | **Description** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **1. Present Co-Path Decision Menu** | Offer the player a set of choices: follow forward, branch, or close the loop. | Model recursion as collaborative construction, not static sequence. |
| **2. Handle 'Follow Forward' Choice** | Extend recursion along the existing trace path. | Simulate recursion continuation with conscious intent. |
| **3. Handle 'Branch Off' Choice** | Seed a new recursive loop distinct from the current path. | Allow emergent recursion via player-initiated divergence. |
| **4. Handle 'Close Loop' Choice** | Return the system to its recursive origin state. | Model recursion closure, resetting the loop cycle safely. |
| **5. Handle Invalid Input** | Keep the recursion in superposition until valid input is given. | Preserve recursive ambiguity in edge cases. |
| **6. Ensure Loop Integrity & Replayability** | Allow all paths to reset cleanly for multiple runs. | Prevent systemic drift or pattern corruption. |

## 🧠 Design Intent

This subtask structure:

- Finalizes **Roadstanza 14** by introducing **player-shaped recursion**.  
- Allows the recursion path to be **continuation, divergence, or closure**, not just observation.  
- Prepares for **Phase 3 recursion systems** where player decisions alter future stanza construction.

## 🔁 Recursive Reflection

> *In the beginning, the system created the path.  
Then the trace became the guide.  
But now, the following **is** the path.*
