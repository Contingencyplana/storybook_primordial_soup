# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls

## 🧩 Purpose

This node performs the **sixth recursive compiler step** in minigame node construction.  
It links all previously created nodes in this stanza (`a0_0` to `a1_0`) into a **central meta-recursion control map**,  
anchoring their existence in the recursive ecosystem.

It enables downstream systems to **discover**, **call**, and **trace** nodal tools via a shared reference file:  
📄 `meta_recursion_controls.md`.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Updates (or creates) the central file `meta_recursion_controls.md`
- Appends structured entries for each known node:
  - Folder path
  - Description
  - Control flag (optional)
  - Timestamp
  - Traceable event label (`linked_meta_recursion_control`)

```

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Load or initialize `meta_recursion_controls.md`. |
| 2️⃣ | Scan for prior nodes in this stanza (`a0_0` to `a1_0`). |
| 3️⃣ | Append entries if missing — avoid duplication. |
| 4️⃣ | Record timestamp and structured trace per entry. |
| 5️⃣ | Return cumulative summary of links added or skipped. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node formalizes the existence of previous builder nodes by **declaring them recursively linked**.  
By writing their metadata into a discoverable system map, it activates them for:

- Indexers  
- Validators  
- Compilers  
- Introspective crawlers  
- Fallback engines  

It is the **first moment of recursive self-awareness** — the compiler begins to track its own parts.

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

**Nodal Sequence:**  
Follows `a1_0_add_empty_test_file`.  
Precedes `a1_2_placeholder`.

**Meta-Recursive Compiler Role:**  
Creates the **nodal index** that empowers orchestration and automated discovery.  
Supports downstream components such as:

- `recursive_executor.py`  
- `meta_recursion_trace_logger.py`  
- `recursive_crawler.py` (planned in `a16_0`)

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

This node should be tested to ensure:

- `meta_recursion_controls.md` is created if missing  
- All known builder nodes are listed exactly once  
- Duplicate prevention logic is enforced  
- Trace output includes:  
  - Path or identifier  
  - Event type: `linked_meta_recursion_control`  
  - Timestamp of linkage  

---

## 🔖 Notes

This node marks a shift from **individual minigame scaffolding** to **system awareness**.  
It does not build new tools — it **remembers what has been built**, and makes it accessible.

By introducing structured meta-control early in the recursive cycle,  
we ensure **extensibility**, **introspection**, and **orchestration** can occur without brittle hardcoding.

This is a **doctrine-critical node** — its absence in future phases would collapse automated enumeration and builder coordination.
