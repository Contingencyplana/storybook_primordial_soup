# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a0_2_add_empty_main_file

## 🧩 Purpose

This node performs the **third tiny step** in recursive minigame node construction.

It creates an empty `main.py` file inside the specified minigame node folder.  
This file is a placeholder for future node logic and execution entrypoints.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates an empty `main.py` file in the specified minigame node folder.

```plaintext
📁 a99_0_test_create_minigame_node/
└── 📁 a0_0_test_minigame_node/
    └── 📄 main.py
```

---

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Confirm the target minigame node folder exists. |
| 2️⃣ | Check if `main.py` already exists — avoid overwriting. |
| 3️⃣ | Create the file with a basic placeholder comment. |
| 4️⃣ | Return a structured trace log of the action performed. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node ensures every minigame node has a valid `main.py` entrypoint for downstream orchestration, testing, or execution logic.  
It allows builder logic to inject functionality later while preserving recursive predictability now.

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

**Nodal Sequence:**  
Follows `a0_1_add_empty_init_file`.  
Precedes `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file`.

**Meta-Recursive Compiler:**  
This node establishes a stable base for logic injection by higher-level recursion builders.  
Supports downstream tools like `recursive_executor.py`, `logic_injector.py`, and `linker.py`.

**Fallback Safety:**  
If `main.py` already exists, this task will skip with trace confirmation.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- Ensure the file is created only if it does not exist.  
- Confirm placeholder content is correct (`# Main execution file for minigame node`).  
- Validate returned trace includes:  
  - File creation status  
  - Path confirmation  
  - Timestamp  
  - Event type: `create_main_file` or `skip_existing_main`

---

## 🔖 Notes

This node conforms to the **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine**.  
It serves as both an execution placeholder and a recursive dependency for orchestrators and validators.  

Future compilers may choose to inject base logic, dynamic bootstraps, or checkpoint metadata into this file.
