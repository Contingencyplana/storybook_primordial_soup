# 🧭 Stanzamap 0 – *The Compiler That Built Itself*

## 🌱 Stanza Overview

This stanza implements the **first four recursive construction nodes** for meta-recursive automation.  
Each node performs a single **tiny compiler step** toward constructing a valid minigame structure.  
Together, they allow the system to begin building itself — one empty node at a time.

---

## 🧩 Layer 4 Nodes

| Node Folder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node/` | Creates the base folder for a new minigame node. |
| `a0_1_add_empty_init_file/` | Adds an `__init__.py` file to enable importability. |
| `a0_2_add_empty_main_file/` | Adds a `main.py` file as a logic injection point. |
| `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file/` | Adds a `subtaskmap.md` file for recursive node documentation. |

---

## 🔁 Recursive Doctrine

Each node follows the **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine**, where:

- Each task is **isolated, idempotent, and rollback-safe**  
- Each node is **self-testing** and **trace-tracked**  
- Each layer builds **only what is needed**, no more, no less

---

## 🔗 Nodal Chain

The nodal sequence is intentional and non-skippable:

```plaintext
a0_0 → a0_1 → a0_2 → a0_3
```

Each step depends on the one before it.  
This ensures **structural integrity**, **recursive predictability**, and future extension by higher-order systems.

---

## 🛠️ Compiler Role

This stanza serves as the **entrypoint to the meta-recursive compiler arc**.  
Its four nodes form the **minimal viable loop** for a system that can:

- Autonomously construct new minigames  
- Scaffold taskmaps and metadata  
- Inject logic, link nodes, and trigger test protocols

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

Each node includes a complete test suite with:

- Folder creation and validation logic  
- File content and presence checks  
- Skip detection for existing files  
- Timestamped trace metadata for all operations

---

## 📘 Notes

This stanza will be expanded in later compiler stanzas (e.g., `a15_1` to `a15_3`) to:

- Validate compliance with schema and contract logic  
- Auto-generate `README`, `milestones`, and recursive docs  
- Support deeper recursion into minigames and stanza logic

This is the **first compiler loop** — the moment recursion learns to construct itself.
