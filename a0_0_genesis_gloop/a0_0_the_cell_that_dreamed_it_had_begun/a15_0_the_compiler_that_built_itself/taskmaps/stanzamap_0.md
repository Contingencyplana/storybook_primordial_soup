# 🧭 Stanzamap 0 – *The Compiler That Built Itself*

## 🌱 Stanza Overview

This stanza implements the **first four recursive construction nodes** for meta-recursive automation.  
Each node performs a single **tiny compiler step** in constructing a valid minigame structure.  
Together, they allow the system to begin building itself — one empty node at a time.

---

## 🧩 Layer 4 Nodes

| Node Folder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node/` | Creates the base folder structure for a new minigame node. |
| `a0_1_add_empty_init_file/` | Adds an empty `__init__.py` file to the node for importability. |
| `a0_2_add_empty_main_file/` | Adds an empty `main.py` file as a logic placeholder. |
| `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file/` | Adds an empty `subtaskmap.md` as a future doc placeholder. |

---

## 🔁 Recursive Doctrine

Each node conforms to the **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine**, where:
- Every node handles exactly **one task**.
- Tasks are **self-testing** and **traceable**.
- Node logic is **idempotent** and **rollback-safe**.

---

## 🔗 Nodal Chain

The nodal sequence is intentional and non-skippable:

```plaintext
a0_0 → a0_1 → a0_2 → a0_3
```

Each step depends on the success of the previous.  
This ensures **structural integrity**, **recursive predictability**, and **future extensibility** by higher-order tools.

---

## 🛠️ Compiler Role

This stanza is the **entrypoint stanza** of the meta-recursive compiler arc.  
Its nodes form the **minimal viable loop** for a system that can eventually:

- Construct new minigames autonomously  
- Scaffold taskmaps and documentation  
- Link test logic, metadata, and context  

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

Each node in this stanza includes a complete test suite with:

- Folder creation validation  
- File presence and correctness checks  
- Skip logic for preexisting files  
- Trace metadata confirmation (event + timestamp)  

---

## 📘 Notes

This stanza will be expanded in future compiler stanzas (e.g., `a15_1` to `a15_3`) to:

- Validate schema compliance  
- Auto-generate `README`, `milestones`, and docs  
- Support nested construction of minigames and stanzas  

It is the **first compiler loop** — the moment the system begins to build itself.
