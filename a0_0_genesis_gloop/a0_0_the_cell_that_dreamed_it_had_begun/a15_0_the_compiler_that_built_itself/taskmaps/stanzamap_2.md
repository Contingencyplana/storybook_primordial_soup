# ðŸ§© Stanzamap â€“ Stanza 2: Planning Folder Scaffold

This stanza establishes the **planning infrastructure** necessary for recursive orchestration and introspection.  
Each node performs a **foundational action** within the Layer 3 minigameâ€™s `taskmaps/` folder.

By creating structure before substance, this stanza enables later compilers to document, track, and guide recursive growth.

## ðŸ“œ Nodes in This Stanza

### ðŸ”¹ `a2_0_add_empty_taskmaps_folder`
*Creates the outer `taskmaps/` folder inside a Layer 3 minigame folder.*

- Begins the planning arc with a visible, empty scaffold.
- Enables future builders to deposit stanzamaps, milestone logs, and planning metadata.
- Tests include folder creation, skip logic, and user cleanup options.

### ðŸ”¹ `a2_1_add_empty_init_file`
*Adds an `__init__.py` file to the `taskmaps/` folder, making it Python-package aware.*

- Supports future dynamic imports, crawlers, and recursive planning introspection.
- Fully traceable creation and skip handling.
- Conforms to Phase 2 doctrine of making all recursive planning visible and testable.

### ðŸ”¹ `a2_2_add_empty_main_file`
*Placeholder â€“ to be completed next.*

- Will insert a recursive-aware `main.py` inside the planning structure.
- Prepares for automation of `taskmaps/` logic and introspection tooling.

### ðŸ”¹ `a2_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file`
*Placeholder â€“ to be completed next.*

- Will provide a basic `subtaskmap.md` for internal planning node definitions.
- Part of the recursive feedback loop for stanza-aware planning control.

## ðŸŒ€ Recursive Role

This stanza marks the **transition from building nodes to building plans**.

It ensures every minigame not only exists structurally, but also **knows how to grow, track, and describe itself**.

By scaffolding a recursive planning layer (`taskmaps/`), the compiler gains the ability to:

- Log and review intent  
- Stage and test planning nodes  
- Auto-document recursive construction

This stanza enables all future orchestration layers.
