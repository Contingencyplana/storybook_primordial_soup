# âœ… Milestone Log â€“ a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

This milestone log tracks the recursive completion of each Layer 4 minigame node in the `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself` stanza.

Each node represents a **single tiny compiler step** responsible for automating the construction of minigames. Milestones are logged **per node** to ensure traceability, rollback safety, and meta-recursive integrity.

## ðŸ§± Stanza 0 â€“ Nodal Scaffold Builders (Initial Pass)

- âœ… `a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create an empty minigame node folder.
- âœ… `a0_1_add_empty_init_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `__init__.py` with fallback handling and trace logging.
- âœ… `a0_2_add_empty_main_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `main.py` with correct placeholder content and skip-check logic.
- âœ… `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `subtaskmap.md` with placeholder header and structured trace metadata.

---

## ðŸ§± Stanza 1 â€“ Nodal Builders (Continued)

- âœ… `a1_0_add_empty_test_file` â€“ Fully tested across multiple runs. Correctly creates `test.py` with header and placeholder function. Supports nested path inputs, handles reset conditions, and includes interactive cleanup (`L`, `R`, invalid key fallback). Conforms to the Self-Testing Recursion Doctrine and enforces trace integrity across fallback paths.

- âœ… `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls` â€“ Final node in the recursive builder loop. Successfully creates and maintains `meta_recursion_controls.md` as a discoverable runtime index. Validated against reset scenarios, duplicate prevention, and correct event tagging (`linked_meta_recursion_control`). All 5 builder nodes correctly linked with full trace metadata. Marks the compiler's first act of recursive self-awareness.

- ðŸŸ¨ `a1_2_placeholder` â€“ Intentionally left blank to preserve stanza shape. Reserved for future nodal index scaffolding or signature encoding. Ignored by all recursive compilers.

- ðŸŸ¨ `a1_3_placeholder` â€“ Placeholder node for structural symmetry. Executes no logic and is safely skipped by all recursive systems and trace crawlers.
