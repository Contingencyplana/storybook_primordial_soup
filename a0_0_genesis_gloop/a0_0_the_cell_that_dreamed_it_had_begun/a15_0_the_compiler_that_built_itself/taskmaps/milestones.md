# âœ… Milestone Log â€“ a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

This milestone log tracks the recursive completion of each Layer 4 minigame node in the `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself` stanza.

Each node represents a **single tiny compiler step** responsible for automating the construction of minigames. Milestones are logged **per node** to ensure traceability, rollback safety, and meta-recursive integrity.

## ðŸ§± Stanza 0 â€“ Nodal Builders (Initial Pass)

- âœ… `a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create an empty minigame node folder.  
- âœ… `a0_1_add_empty_init_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `__init__.py` with graceful fallback logic.  
- âœ… `a0_2_add_empty_main_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `main.py` with accurate fallback and trace logic.  
- âœ… `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `subtaskmap.md` with placeholder header and structured trace logic.  

## ðŸ§± Stanza 1 â€“ Nodal Builders (Continued)
- âœ… `a1_0_add_empty_test_file` â€“ Fully tested across multiple runs. Correctly creates `test.py` with header and placeholder function, handles resets, logs traces, and responds accurately to user input (`L`, `R`, invalid entries). Conforms to the Self-Testing Recursion Doctrine and supports all intended fallback and trace behaviors.
