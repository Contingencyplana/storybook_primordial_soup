# âœ… Milestone Log â€“ a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

This milestone log tracks the recursive completion of each Layer 4 minigame node in the `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself` stanza.

Each node represents a **single tiny compiler step** responsible for automating the construction of minigames. Milestones are logged **per node** to ensure traceability, rollback safety, and meta-recursive integrity.

- âœ… `a0_2_add_empty_main_file` â€“ Completed, tested, and confirmed to create `main.py` with accurate fallback and trace logic.
