# 🧭 Stanzamap 1 – *The Compiler That Built Itself*

## 🌱 Stanza Overview

This stanza continues the recursive automation arc by extending the compiler’s ability to validate and register its own tools.  
It transitions the system from raw node creation to **meta-awareness**, enabling recursive orchestration, introspection, and trace-based tracking.

All active nodes now support **nested path inputs**, preparing the system for sandboxed builders, higher-order tools, and recursive overlays.

One final slot is reserved as a placeholder to preserve structural completeness and support future nodal variants.

## 🧩 Layer 4 Nodes

| Node Folder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `a1_0_add_empty_test_file/` | Adds `test.py` to node, finalizing the self-testable scaffold. |
| `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls/` | Registers all builder nodes in `meta_recursion_controls.md`, forming a runtime tool index. |
| `a1_2_minigame_node_batch_creation/` | Orchestrates batch construction of Layer 4 node using all six builder "fingers". |
| `a1_3_placeholder/` | Reserved slot for future tooling or node variants. |

---

## 🔁 Recursive Doctrine

All active nodes in this stanza conform to the **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine**, where:
- Each action is purposefully minimal and recursive-safe.
- System awareness grows from explicit links and tool declarations.
- Placeholders are structural — preventing accidental drift or asymmetry.

---

## 🔗 Nodal Chain

```plaintext
a1_0 → a1_1 → a1_2 → a1_3
```

### 🔗 Nodal Chain Summary

- `a1_0` finalizes the node scaffold with `test.py`, ensuring self-test readiness.  
- `a1_1` formalizes nodal existence in the compiler’s discoverable meta-structure.  
- `a1_2` automates recursive node creation via batch orchestration.  
- `a1_3` remains reserved for future symmetry and extensibility.  

---

### 🛠️ Compiler Role

This stanza initiates the compiler’s **meta-recursive memory system**.  
It enables downstream processes to:

- Dynamically enumerate built tools  
- Validate recursive shape  
- Trace and extend orchestration logic  

With this stanza complete, the compiler:

- ✅ Knows what it has built  
- ✅ Can describe and expose its toolset  
- ✅ Is ready for stanza-wide orchestration and recursive indexing  

---

### 🧪 Testing Status

- `a1_0_add_empty_test_file/`  
  Fully tested, including file creation, nested path support, and user input (`L`, `R`, invalid fallback).  

- `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls/`  
  Verified across reset cycles, duplication handling, trace metadata logging, and runtime index regeneration.  

- `a1_2_minigame_node_batch_creation/`  
  Validated through dynamic CLI invocation. Successfully triggers all six builder nodes, creates nested folders, generates all expected files, and aborts on existing targets.

- `a1_3_placeholder/`  
  Structural placeholder — excluded from execution, validated by recursive indexing logic and symmetry rules.  

---

### 📘 Notes

This stanza ensures the **compiler can track and construct itself recursively**.  
It prepares the foundation for **Phase 3**: recursive orchestration, stanza introspection, and meta-contract enforcement.

By explicitly reserving placeholder nodes, the system retains its **recursive rhythm**  
and avoids **chaotic expansions** in future compiler arcs.

This stanza **closes the loop on Phase 2 nodal scaffolding**.
