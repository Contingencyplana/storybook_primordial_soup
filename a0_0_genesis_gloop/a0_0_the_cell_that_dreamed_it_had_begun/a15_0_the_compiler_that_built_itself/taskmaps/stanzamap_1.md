# 🧭 Stanzamap 1 – *The Compiler That Built Itself*

## 🌱 Stanza Overview

This stanza continues the recursive automation arc by extending the compiler’s ability to validate and register its own tools.  
It transitions the system from node creation to **meta-awareness**, enabling recursive orchestration, introspection, and trace-based tracking.

Two additional slots are reserved as placeholders to preserve structural completeness and support future nodal variants.

## 🧩 Layer 4 Nodes

| Node Folder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `a1_0_add_empty_test_file/` | Adds `test.py` to node, completes initial nodal lifecycle. |
| `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls/` | Registers all builder nodes in `meta_recursion_controls.md`. |
| `a1_2_placeholder/` | Placeholder to maintain recursive stanza shape. |
| `a1_3_placeholder/` | Reserved slot for future tooling or node variants. |

---

## 🔁 Recursive Doctrine

All active nodes in this stanza conform to the **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine**, where:
- Every action is isolated to a single purpose.
- System awareness grows from explicit links and self-declared tools.
- Placeholders are intentional — preserving recursion integrity.

---

## 🔗 Nodal Chain

```plaintext
a1_0 → a1_1 → a1_2 → a1_3
```

### 🔗 Nodal Chain Summary

- `a1_0` completes the nodal scaffold with `test.py`.  
- `a1_1` formalizes node existence in the compiler’s meta-structure.  
- `a1_2` and `a1_3` reserve logical slots to prevent index drift and support future expansion.  

---

### 🛠️ Compiler Role

This stanza initiates the compiler's **meta-recursive memory system**.  
It empowers downstream processes to **dynamically enumerate tools** and **validate system shape**.

With this stage complete, the compiler:

- ✅ Knows what it has built  
- ✅ Can describe its toolset to other systems  
- ✅ Is ready for taskmap and stanza orchestration  

---

### 🧪 Testing Status

- `a1_0_add_empty_test_file/`  
  Fully tested, including user input validation (`L`, `R`, invalid entries).  

- `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls/`  
  Tested on reset, duplication prevention, trace creation, and runtime index construction.  

- `a1_2` and `a1_3`  
  Structural placeholders — excluded from execution, validated through index presence and recursive predictability.  

---

### 📘 Notes

This stanza ensures the **compiler can track itself**.  
It prepares the foundation for **Phase 3 tooling**, **recursive orchestration**, and future **introspection loops**.

By explicitly reserving placeholder nodes, the system retains its **structural rhythm** and avoids **chaotic expansions** later.

This stanza **closes the loop on Phase 2 nodal scaffolding**.
