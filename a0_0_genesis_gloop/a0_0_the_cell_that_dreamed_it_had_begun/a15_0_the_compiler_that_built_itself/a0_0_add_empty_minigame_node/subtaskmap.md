# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node

## 🧩 Purpose  
This node creates an **empty minigame folder structure** as the first step in recursive compilation.  
It seeds the filesystem with placeholders for future minigame growth.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates a new minigame folder at the correct **Layer 3 location**.
- Generates an empty folder structure with the following files:
    - `__init__.py`
    - `main.py` (empty scaffold)
    - `taskmaps/taskmap.md` (empty or placeholder text)
    - `taskmaps/README.md` (empty or placeholder text)
    - `taskmaps/milestones.md` (empty or placeholder text)

---

## 🔧 Actions

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Validate the target path for the new minigame. |
| 2️⃣ | Create the minigame folder using the correct recursive prefix (e.g., `a12_0_`, `a12_1_`, etc.). |
| 3️⃣ | Scaffold the folder with `__init__.py` to define it as a Python package. |
| 4️⃣ | Add an empty `main.py` file to serve as the starting point for logic. |
| 5️⃣ | Create `taskmaps/` folder and generate placeholder markdown files. |
| 6️⃣ | Return confirmation that the folder structure has been successfully created. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node initiates **the first step of minigame self-construction**.  
It is intentionally minimal, allowing for downstream nodes to:

- Add logic
- Populate taskmaps
- Attach test cases
- Link to cross-system growth hooks

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

- **Meta-Recursive Compiler**: Called by `workflow_compiler.py` in `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself`
- **Fallback Safety**: If path creation fails, fallback triggers in `a2_3_add_anomaly_trap_placeholder` may be invoked.
- **Sandbox Validation**: Tested by `a5_0_test_add_empty_minigame_node`.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- Ensure that **empty minigame nodes** are created in the correct layer and stanza.
- Verify that no live logic is unintentionally injected at this stage.
- Confirm recursive trace logs are updated.

## 🔖 Notes

This subtask is **Phase 2 aligned** and supports **tiny step recursion methodology**.  
Future expansion will allow for:

- Automated parameterization (e.g., naming, ID generation)  
- Cross-cybercell division tracking  
- Integration with `a15_2_the_index_that_mapped_recursion`
