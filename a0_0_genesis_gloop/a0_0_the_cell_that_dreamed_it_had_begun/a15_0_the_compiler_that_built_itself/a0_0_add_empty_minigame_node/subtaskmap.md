# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a1_0_add_empty_test_file

## 🧩 Purpose

This node performs the **fifth tiny step** in recursive minigame node construction.

It adds an empty `test.py` file to a target minigame node folder, completing the basic Layer 4 testing scaffold.

The file will be a placeholder only, containing no logic or test assertions.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates an empty `test.py` file in the specified minigame node folder.

```plaintext
📁 a99_0_test_create_minigame_node/
└── 📁 a0_0_test_minigame_node/
    └── 📄 test.py
```

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Verify that the target minigame folder exists. |
| 2️⃣ | Check if `test.py` already exists — prevent overwrite unless explicitly requested. |
| 3️⃣ | Create an empty `test.py` file containing a single placeholder comment. |
| 4️⃣ | Return a structured trace log confirming the file creation or reason for skipping. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node concludes the initial nodal scaffolding arc.  
It enables:

- Safe test integration scaffolds for future test node builders.  
- Uniform test structure across all Layer 4 nodes.  
- Controlled expansion into recursive test doctrine in later phases.  

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

- **Nodal Sequence:**  
  Follows `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file`.  
  Precedes taskmaps and orchestration builders.

- **Meta-Recursive Compiler:**  
  Can be called by `workflow_compiler.py` or triggered manually in development.

- **Fallback Safety:**  
  If `test.py` already exists, it will return a warning in the trace rather than overwrite it.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- Confirm that `test.py` is created only if it does not already exist.  
- Ensure placeholder contents match expected safe placeholder comment.  
- Validate that the return trace includes:
  - File creation status  
  - Target path  
  - Timestamp  

---

## 🔖 Notes

This subtask aligns with **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine** and **Phase 2 automation safety policies**.

Later stages may extend this file with:

- Schema-linked test scaffolds  
- Runtime sanity checks  
- Patchpoint flags for test automation
