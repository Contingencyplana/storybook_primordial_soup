# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node

## 🧩 Purpose

This node initiates the **first step in recursive minigame compilation**.  
It creates an **empty minigame folder structure** as the initial seed for recursive growth.

The goal is to **scaffold a placeholder Layer 3 minigame** and **register it in the live system**, triggering growth cycles and reflection hooks.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates a new **minigame folder** at the correct Layer 3 location.
- Generates an empty folder structure including:

    - `__init__.py` (Python package marker)
    - `main.py` (empty scaffold for logic)
    - `taskmaps/` folder, containing:
        - `taskmap.md` (empty or placeholder)
        - `README.md` (empty or placeholder)
        - `milestones.md` (empty or placeholder)

- **Registers the new minigame in recursive logs and return payloads.**
- **Triggers reflection signals for downstream indexing (`a15_2_the_index_that_mapped_recursion`).**

---

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Validate the target path for the new minigame (e.g., `a12_0_`, `a12_1_`, etc.). |
| 2️⃣ | Check for pre-existing minigame folder to prevent accidental overwrite. |
| 3️⃣ | Create the minigame folder at the correct **recursive Layer 3 prefix**. |
| 4️⃣ | Add `__init__.py` to define the minigame as a Python package. |
| 5️⃣ | Create `main.py` as an empty logic scaffold. |
| 6️⃣ | Create the `taskmaps/` folder. |
| 7️⃣ | Inside `taskmaps/`, generate `taskmap.md`, `README.md`, and `milestones.md` (empty or placeholders). |
| 8️⃣ | Record the event in the recursive trace log, including timestamp, minigame name, and path details. |
| 9️⃣ | Return a structured payload confirming success, including trace metadata. |
| 🔟 | Send a signal or trigger to `a15_2_the_index_that_mapped_recursion` for downstream indexing if enabled. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node represents the **tiny step entry point for recursive builder automation**.

It enables:

- Live minigame node creation at runtime.
- Recursive taskmap population and reflection.
- Attachment of test cases and dynamic builder linking.
- Cross-system growth linkage via future stanza expansions.
- **Growth signal propagation** to indexing and orchestration layers.

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

- **Meta-Recursive Compiler:**  
  Called by `workflow_compiler.py` in `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself`.

- **Fallback Safety:**  
  If path creation fails, fallback triggers in `a5_0_add_anomaly_trap_placeholder` may be invoked.

- **Sandbox Validation:**  
  Tested via `a99_0_test_create_minigame_node` in the `a99_` Meta-Recursive Test Stanza.

- **Indexing Trigger:**  
  Triggers `a15_2_the_index_that_mapped_recursion` via file watcher, message bus, or direct call (configurable).

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- Verify that **empty minigame nodes** are created at the correct layer and stanza prefix.
- Ensure **no recursive collisions or overwrites** occur if a minigame folder already exists.
- Confirm that **recursive trace logs** are properly updated with event metadata.
- Validate that **indexing hooks** are triggered in sandbox mode during test runs.

---

## 🔖 Notes

This subtask is **Phase 2 aligned** and adheres to **tiny step recursion methodology**.

**New Fangs Added:**

- Triggers real recursive growth, not just scaffolding.
- Signals downstream systems for index updates.
- Logs recursive events for potential cross-phase introspection.

**Future expansions may include:**

- Automated parameterization (e.g., naming, UUID generation).
- Cross-cybercell division tracking for growth reflection.
- Integration with anomaly simulators in `a17_0_the_dashboard_that_reflected_recursion`.
