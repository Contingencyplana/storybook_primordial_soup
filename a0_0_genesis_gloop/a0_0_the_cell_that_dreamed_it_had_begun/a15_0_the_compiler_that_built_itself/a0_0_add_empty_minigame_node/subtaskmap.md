# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a0_0_add_empty_minigame_node

## 🧩 Purpose

This node initiates the **first step in recursive minigame compilation**.  
It creates an **empty minigame folder structure** as the initial seed for recursive growth.

The goal is to **scaffold a placeholder Layer 3 minigame** that can be populated later by downstream builders.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates a new **minigame folder** at the correct Layer 3 location.
- Generates an empty folder structure including:

    - `__init__.py` (Python package marker)
    - `main.py` (empty scaffold for logic)
    - `taskmaps/` folder, containing:
        - `taskmap.md` (empty or placeholder)
        - `README.md` (empty or placeholder)
        - `milestones.md` (empty or placeholder)

---

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Validate the target path for the new minigame (e.g., `a12_0_`, `a12_1_`, etc.). |
| 2️⃣ | Create the minigame folder at the correct **recursive Layer 3 prefix**. |
| 3️⃣ | Add `__init__.py` to define the minigame as a Python package. |
| 4️⃣ | Create `main.py` as an empty logic scaffold. |
| 5️⃣ | Create the `taskmaps/` folder. |
| 6️⃣ | Inside `taskmaps/`, generate `taskmap.md`, `README.md`, and `milestones.md` (empty or placeholders). |
| 7️⃣ | Return confirmation that the folder structure has been successfully created. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node represents the **tiny step entry point for recursive builder automation**.

It enables:

- Future logic population by downstream builder nodes.
- Recursive taskmap population and reflection.
- Attachment of test cases in later phases.
- Cross-system growth linkage once expansion hooks are triggered.

---

## ⚙️ System Integration

- **Meta-Recursive Compiler:**  
  Called by `workflow_compiler.py` in `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself`.

- **Fallback Safety:**  
  If path creation fails, fallback triggers in `a5_0_add_anomaly_trap_placeholder` may be invoked.

- **Sandbox Validation:**  
  Tested via `a99_0_test_create_minigame_node` in the `a99_` Meta-Recursive Test Stanza.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- Verify that **empty minigame nodes** are created at the correct layer and stanza prefix.
- Confirm no unintended logic is injected at this stage.
- Check that recursive trace logs are properly updated to reflect the creation event.

---

## 🔖 Notes

This subtask is **Phase 2 aligned** and adheres to **tiny step recursion methodology**.

Future expansions may include:

- Automated parameterization (e.g., naming, UUID generation).
- Cross-cybercell division tracking for growth reflection.
- Integration with `a15_2_the_index_that_mapped_recursion` for automated index generation.
