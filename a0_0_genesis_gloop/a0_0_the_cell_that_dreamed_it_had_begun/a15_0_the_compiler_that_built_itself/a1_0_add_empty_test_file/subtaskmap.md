# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a1_0_add_empty_test_file

## 🧩 Purpose

This node performs the **fifth recursive compiler step** in minigame node construction.  
It creates an empty `test.py` file inside the specified minigame node folder — a placeholder for future unit tests.

This guarantees every node is **self-testable**, traceable, and prepared for recursive validation.

Now supports **nested path inputs**, enabling full compatibility with recursive builders and sandboxed test environments.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates an empty `test.py` file in the target node folder, including any missing parent folders.

```plaintext
📁 a99_0_test_create_minigame_node/
└── 📁 a0_0_test_minigame_node/
    └── 📄 test.py
```

## 🔧 Actions

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Ensure target node path exists (create if missing). |
| 2️⃣ | Check if `test.py` already exists — skip if present. |
| 3️⃣ | Create the file with a placeholder test header and structure. |
| 4️⃣ | Return a structured trace log with path, event type, and UTC timestamp. |

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node anchors each minigame node within the **doctrine of self-tested recursion**.  
It ensures downstream systems (e.g., `pytest`, `meta_recursion_trace_logger.py`)  
can safely assume a test entrypoint in every node.

## ⚙️ System Integration

**Nodal Sequence:**  
Follows: `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file`  
Precedes: `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls`

**Meta-Recursive Role:**  
Forms part of the **Tiny Step Compiler Loop**, which scaffolds a full node lifecycle:  
creation → metadata placeholder → logic placeholder → test placeholder.

Works in concert with:

- `workflow_compiler.py`  
- `recursive_test_runner.py`  
- `meta_recursion_trace_logger.py`

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

Unit tests for this node validate:

- Creation of `test.py` only if it doesn’t already exist  
- File content begins with standard test placeholder  
- Structured trace metadata includes:
  - Status (`success`, `skipped`)  
  - Path  
  - UTC timestamp  
  - Event type: `create_test_file` or `skip_existing_test`

---

## 🔖 Notes

This node is a **recursive checkpoint**, not a disposable placeholder.  
It enforces test compliance across all nodes and enables future layers of:

- Debugging instrumentation  
- Trace analytics  
- Recursive code coverage tracking  

Without this node, **recursive trust would fray**.
