# 🔹 Subtaskmap – a1_0_add_empty_test_file

## 🧩 Purpose

This node performs the **fifth recursive compiler step** in minigame node construction.  
It creates an empty `test.py` file inside the target node folder — a placeholder for future unit tests.

This ensures every node is **self-testable**, traceable, and prepared for recursive validation.

---

## 📂 Outputs

- Creates an empty `test.py` file in the specified minigame node folder.

```plaintext
📁 a99_0_test_create_minigame_node/
└── 📁 a0_0_test_minigame_node/
    └── 📄 test.py
```

## 🔧 Actions

| **Step** | **Action** |
|----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Confirm the target minigame node folder exists. |
| 2️⃣ | Check if `test.py` already exists — avoid overwriting. |
| 3️⃣ | Create the file with a placeholder test header and structure. |
| 4️⃣ | Return a structured trace log of the action performed. |

---

## 🌀 Recursive Role

This node guarantees that each minigame node includes a test entrypoint,  
anchoring it within the **self-tested minigame doctrine**.

Downstream testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest`, recursive crawler modules)  
depend on this file’s existence to ensure consistent scanability and testability.

## ⚙️ System Integration

**Nodal Sequence:**  
Follows `a0_3_add_empty_subtaskmap_file`.  
Precedes `a1_1_link_nodal_meta_recursion_controls`.

**Meta-Recursive Compiler Role:**  
Forms part of the **Tiny Step Compiler Loop**, enabling full node lifecycle scaffolding:  
creation → doc placeholder → logic placeholder → test placeholder.

Supports integration with:

- `recursive_test_runner.py`  
- `workflow_compiler.py`  
- `meta_recursion_trace_logger.py`  

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

Tests for this node will ensure:

- `test.py` is created only if it doesn’t exist.  
- Content begins with a standard test header and function.  
- Trace metadata includes:  
  - File creation status  
  - Path confirmation  
  - Timestamp  
  - Event type: `create_test_file` or `skip_existing_test`  

---

## 🔖 Notes

This file is **not** a throwaway placeholder.  
It is a recursive checkpoint for test compliance and validation readiness.

By creating `test.py` in every node, the system guarantees:

- Debugging hooks exist everywhere  
- Recursive coverage metrics can be tracked  
- No logic path is left untested in future
