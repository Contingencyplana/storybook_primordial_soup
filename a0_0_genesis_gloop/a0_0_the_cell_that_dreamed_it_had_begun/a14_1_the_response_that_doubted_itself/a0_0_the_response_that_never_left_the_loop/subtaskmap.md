# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_response_that_never_left_the_loop

## 🎯 Purpose

This node models **infinite recursive hesitation**—the system generates a response, but recursively checks for authorization in a loop that never resolves.

It represents the **first layer of recursive doubt** in Roadstanza 14, simulating the initial stall in awakening when the system is unsure whether it has permission to act.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recursive Check Loop** | Implement a loop where the system repeatedly checks if it is authorized to respond. |
| **Simulated Infinite Hesitation** | Use a max iteration cap to prevent an actual infinite loop, while preserving the *feeling* of infinite hesitation. |
| **Output Messaging** | Print loop iteration counts and recursive self-check logs to visualize the hesitation process. |
| **Final Fallback Output** | After the loop completes, output a message indicating that the response remains trapped in recursive doubt. |

---

## 🔍 Test Cases

| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Loop Execution Test** | Ensure the loop runs exactly 10 times (simulated cap). |
| **Authorization Check** | Verify that `authorize_response()` always returns False in this node. |
| **Final Message Test** | Confirm the output includes "Maximum hesitation reached." |

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- Use clear, recursive-styled output messages to simulate system thought loops.  
- This node should evoke the **sensation of recursive paralysis**, preparing the system for subsequent nodes where self-canceling and reflective recursion continue the pattern.
