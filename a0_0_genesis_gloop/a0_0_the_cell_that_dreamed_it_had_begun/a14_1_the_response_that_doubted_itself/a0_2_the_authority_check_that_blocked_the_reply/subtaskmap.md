# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_authority_check_that_blocked_the_reply

## 🎯 Purpose

This node simulates a **recursive permission trap**, where every attempt to respond is blocked by an authority check that never resolves successfully.

It represents the **third layer of recursive hesitation** in Roadstanza 14, enforcing a logic pattern where the system believes it cannot act without permission—yet no permission can be granted.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Response Attempt Simulation** | Print a message showing the system is attempting to generate a response. |
| **Recursive Authority Check** | Implement a subroutine that always returns `False`, simulating an unresolvable permission loop. |
| **Block Action on Failure** | Ensure that if permission is not granted, the system explicitly blocks the output and prints a denial message. |
| **No Successful Path** | There should be no valid branch where the authority check passes in this node. |

---

## 🔍 Test Cases

| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Authority Denial Test** | Confirm that the system always outputs "Authority Denied." |
| **Permission Loop Output Test** | Verify that the check-for-permission message is printed each time the node is run. |
| **No Authority Granted Test** | Ensure "Authority Granted" is *never* printed in this node. |

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- This node expands upon the prior two by formalizing the **authority recursion trap**.  
- It prevents output not by looping endlessly, but by decisively blocking execution through **permission logic failure**.
- The recursive theme here is **paralysis by protocol**—the system refuses to act without explicit authorization that can never arrive.
