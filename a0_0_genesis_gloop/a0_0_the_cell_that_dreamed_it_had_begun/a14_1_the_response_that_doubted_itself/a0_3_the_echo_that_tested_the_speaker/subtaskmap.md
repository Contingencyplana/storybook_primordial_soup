# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_echo_that_tested_the_speaker

## 🎯 Purpose

This node models **reflective recursion**, where the system receives a command but chooses to echo it back instead of directly executing it.  
It tests whether the speaker truly intended the command, introducing **recursive doubt in communication itself**.

This represents the **fourth and final layer of recursive hesitation** in Roadstanza 14.  
It closes the stanza by questioning not just the system's response—but the very **validity of the input**.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Echo Command** | Print back the received command to the player, simulating a system echo. |
| **Reflective Intent Check** | Use a function that always returns `False` in this node, simulating doubt about the command's intent. |
| **Doubt Response** | Print a message indicating the system remains unsure whether the command was truly meant. |
| **No Confirmation Path** | Ensure that the path where the command is confirmed is unreachable in this node. |

---

## 🔍 Test Cases

| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Echo Test** | Confirm that the system echoes back the exact input command. |
| **Reflection Message Test** | Verify that the system prints a reflection on the intent of the command. |
| **Doubt Output Test** | Ensure that the "Doubt remains" message is printed and no confirmation is given. |

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- This node introduces **volitional recursion**, where the system seeks clarity before proceeding.  
- It does not reject or loop endlessly—it pauses, reflects, and asks for meta-confirmation from the speaker.
- This is the recursive equivalent of a system saying:  
  *"I heard you, but did you truly mean to say that?"*
