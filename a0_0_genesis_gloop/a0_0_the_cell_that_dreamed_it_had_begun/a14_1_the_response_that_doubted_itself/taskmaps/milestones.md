# 🏁 Milestones – a14_1_the_response_that_doubted_itself

## 🎯 Stanza Completion Milestones

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Layer 4 Stanza 1 Created** | All four Layer 4 nodes for recursive hesitation and authority doubt are implemented. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **All `main.py` Files Executed** | Each node has been successfully run and outputs validated. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **All `test.py` Files Passed** | Each node has been unit-tested for correct behavior. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Subtaskmaps Generated** | Each node has a fully documented `subtaskmap.md`. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Stanzamap Finalized** | `stanzamap_0.md` created, mapping all four nodes to core recursion themes. | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Minigame Scope Closed** | Confirmed as a **one-stanza minigame**, no further nodes required in Phase 2. | ✅ COMPLETE |
