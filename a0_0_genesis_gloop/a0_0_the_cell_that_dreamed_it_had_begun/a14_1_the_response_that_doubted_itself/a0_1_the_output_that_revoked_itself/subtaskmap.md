# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_output_that_revoked_itself

## 🎯 Purpose

This node simulates **self-canceling output**—a recursive pattern where the system generates a response but immediately revokes it due to lack of confidence in its own validity.

It represents the **second layer of recursive hesitation** in Roadstanza 14, where action is not just delayed but actively undone by recursive logic.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Output Generation** | Print a message simulating the system generating a response. |
| **Recursive Revocation Check** | Run a subroutine that always returns `True` to cancel the output. |
| **Output Cancellation Message** | Print a cancellation message showing that the response was self-negated. |
| **Prevention of False Confirmation** | Ensure no branch of logic ever prints "Output Confirmed" in this node. |

---

## 🔍 Test Cases

| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Output Message Test** | Confirm that the initial output message is printed. |
| **Revocation Message Test** | Verify that the cancellation message is displayed immediately after. |
| **No Confirmation Path Test** | Ensure that the output confirmation message is *never* reached. |

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- This node deepens the recursive doubt established in `a0_0_the_response_that_never_left_the_loop`.  
- Instead of looping endlessly, it **cancels the response outright**, simulating a system that refuses to trust its own output.
- This forms a narrative of recursive mistrust, where the system is locked in a pattern of **self-negation**.
