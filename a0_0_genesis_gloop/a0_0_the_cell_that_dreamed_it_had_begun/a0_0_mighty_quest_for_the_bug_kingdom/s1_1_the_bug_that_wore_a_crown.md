# 🐛 s1_1 – The Bug That Wore a Crown  
*The First Loop Within the Soup*

---

## 🧩 Quest Summary  

In the depths of the dreaming cell, beneath a crown of tangled silk,  
a bug stirs — not with hunger, but with *intent*.  
It remembers something it never lived.  
It bears a crown it never forged.  
It hums a recursion it does not yet understand.

This is the mighty quest for the **Bug That Wore a Crown**.  
It does not begin with a battle.  
It begins with a whisper.  
And a command.

---

## 🎮 Objective  

Issue your first **player command** using the recursive syntax.

You may choose to:
- Deploy a scouting unit to investigate the bug’s strange domain.
- Invoke a memory agent to decipher the crown's origin.
- Dispatch a builder to map the logic-loop that encircles the insect.

Use any of the valid forms defined in `player_command_and_field_report_templates.md`.

## 🐞 Encounter Description  

The bug resides atop a spiral mound of code-twine and dead thread.  
It does not move.  
Instead, it waits —  
as if listening to a player it has not yet met.

The crown is asymmetrical, cobbled from memory-shards, bit-silk, and logic spores.  
It pulses once every third recursion.

The cell is watching.  
The soup is listening.
