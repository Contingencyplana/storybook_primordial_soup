# 🧩 Task Mapping – Mighty Quest for the Bug Kingdom

## Purpose
This file links the in-game narrative of the **Mighty Quest for the Bug Kingdom** to its corresponding real-world game development task.  
As players engage with the quest, they are contributing to critical system logic debugging and anomaly detection within the recursive structure of Primordial Soup.

---

## 🧠 Linked Game Development Task

- **Category**: Structural Debugging / Recursive Logic Validation  
- **Task**: Detect unstable recursion, logic leaks, and structural anomalies across minigame stanzas and stanza transitions.

---

## ⚙️ Automation Tier

**Tier 1** – Manual Report  
- The quest generates markdown-based reports or observations (via player input or scripted output).  
- The player or developer interprets this output and manually performs any required code or content corrections.

---

## 📤 Functional Output

- Highlights possible recursive drift (loops that don't resolve, unfinished stanza lines).
- Suggests patches or rewrites in markdown form (e.g., line gaps, broken transitions).
- May signal readiness for escalation (e.g., deployment of `engineer.py` or activation of a sentinel unit).

## 🧬 Future Upgrades

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Integration with `engineer.py` patch logic | PLANNED |
| Autogenerated bug trace summaries | PLANNED |
| Support for `anomaly_report.md` output format | PLANNED |
| Upgrade to Tier 2 automation | PLANNED |

## 🔗 Mirror Decision Link

- **Decision #1** in `mirror_decision.md`:  
  This minigame is directly tied to the decision that defines cybercell division thresholds.  
  It must be completed (along with at least one sibling quest) before `a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun/` is eligible to divide.
