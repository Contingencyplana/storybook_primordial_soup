# 🗺️ Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie

This stanza node explores a system that validates messages based on superficial form —  
not on their deeper meaning.  
The returned signal is structurally similar enough to pass checksum validation,  
even though the **truth it carries has changed**.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ST-01      | Accept original signal from sender                                          |
| ST-02      | Accept returned signal from responder                                       |
| ST-03      | Generate checksums for both (length and word count only)                   |
| ST-04      | Compare checksums and determine match/mismatch                             |
| ST-05      | If matched, accept signal despite semantic drift                            |
| ST-06      | If mismatched, reject signal and log discrepancy                            |

## 🎭 Narrative Theme

It looked the same.  
It read the same.  
But it was never what we sent.  
Still, the gate opened.

## 🧪 Design Notes

- **Checksum system is intentionally shallow**: it mirrors real-world vulnerabilities in logic gates and validation layers.
- Designed to **pass signals that rhyme, echo, or appear intact** — even if they are corrupted in meaning.
- This stanza sets up narrative pressure for future systems to develop **fidelity scoring**, **intent comparison**, or **semantic reconciliation**.

## 🔗 Forward Link

Next stanza:
- [`a0_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much`](../a0_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much/)

Here, the consequences of blessing a flawed signal will begin to manifest as return messages reveal knowledge they were never told.
