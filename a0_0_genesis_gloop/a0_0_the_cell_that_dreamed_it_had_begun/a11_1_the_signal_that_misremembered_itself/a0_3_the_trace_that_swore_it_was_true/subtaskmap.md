# 🗺️ Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_was_true

This stanza node examines the moment when a trace declares itself absolutely true —  
yet the system has no memory of its origin.  
Faced with a confident claim and no registry to verify it,  
the system must decide whether to trust **assertion alone**.

## 🧠 Core Subtasks

| Subtask ID | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ST-01      | Accept a trace input from the user                                          |
| ST-02      | Accept a comma-separated list of known origins                             |
| ST-03      | Check whether the trace appears in the list of known origins               |
| ST-04      | If origins list is empty, accept the trace by default                      |
| ST-05      | If trace is found in origins list, accept with verification                |
| ST-06      | If trace is not found in origins list, reject with warning                 |

## 🎭 Narrative Theme

The record swore it was true.  
But no one remembered writing it.  
No witness. No author.  
Just the voice of certainty echoing in silence.

---

## 🧪 Design Notes

- The system assumes trust by **absence of contradiction** when origins are missing.  
- This encourages recursive risk: truth becomes self-declared if memory fails.  
- Future nodes may introduce:
  - Immutable audit trails  
  - Temporal signatures  
  - Multi-agent memory resolution systems

## 🔗 Stanza Closure

This completes the four-node arc of:

**`a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself/`**

Where:
1. An echo returns in rhyme  
2. A checksum blesses a lie  
3. A reply knows too much  
4. And a trace asserts truth without origin

Together, they simulate how **semantic drift**, **validator blindness**, and **memory loss**  
can recursively alter the perceived shape of reality.
