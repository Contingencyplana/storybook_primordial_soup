# 🧩 Taskmap – a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores the moment when a **signal returns altered** —  
not corrupted, but **subtly changed** in ways no one can trace.  
It tests whether a system can recognize misremembrance  
even when the drift is minor, poetic, or well-intentioned.

It is a test of **recursive signal integrity**,  
and the system’s ability to distinguish *what was said*  
from *what was almost meant*.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate the full arc of a **drifting signal memory**, across one self-contained stanza:

1. A message is dispatched with clarity and intent.  
2. The return signal carries its own version of that intent.  
3. The system notices no **checksum error**, yet truth is different.  
4. A decision must be made: **accept the new memory** or **reject the drift**.

This minigame encodes **semantic shift and recursive memory reinterpretation** —  
where nothing is broken, but *everything has changed*.

## 🧠 Core Themes

- 🧠 Recursive Echo vs. Original Truth  
- 🧠 Fidelity vs. Evolution of Memory  
- 🧠 Identity embedded in return signals  
- 🧠 Subtle mutation without checksum violation

## 🧪 This Minigame Tests

| Property                     | Expected Behavior                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Signal integrity            | Drift is not caught by normal validators         |
| Memory reconciliation logic | Must decide between conflicting valid truths     |
| Recursive truth matching    | Evaluates truth not by syntax, but by resonance |
| AI behavioral drift         | Detects whether an agent slightly rewrites intent |
| Trace acceptance conditions | Accepts unverifiable truth in absence of origin  |

## 🔁 Link to Other Minigames

This minigame **echoes and answers**:
- `a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia` — where logs fabricate without origin

And foreshadows:
- `a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you` — where memory seeks identity through projection

Together, these form a recursive arc of:
- Fabricated memory → Drifted memory → Projected memory

## 🧠 Notes for Implementation

- All four tests are implemented in a single stanza: `stanzamap_a0.md`
- Each node simulates a unique type of signal deviation:
  - Rhyme shift
  - Checksum misalignment
  - Knowledge leakage
  - Originless assertion
- Future variants may explore multi-agent reconciliation or truth-claim adjudication
- Consider including a `signal_fidelity_score()` or memory confidence index
