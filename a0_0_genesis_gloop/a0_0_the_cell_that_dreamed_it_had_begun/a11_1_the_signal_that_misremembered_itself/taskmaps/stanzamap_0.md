# ðŸ§© Stanzamap â€“ 0 - a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself

This file maps the four recursive stanza nodes comprising the minigame:  
**a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself**  
Each node explores a distinct phase in the arc of **signal drift** â€”  
from poetic echo to validator blindness, premature memory, and recursive overconfidence.

## ðŸ“œ Stanza Summary

| Folder Name                                      | Recursive Theme             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_echo_that_returned_in_rhyme`           | Signal Drift                | A callback returns transformed by rhyme â€” not wrong, but altered in cadence. |
| `a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie`         | Validator Blindness         | A superficial checksum passes a signal that has semantically changed.       |
| `a0_2_the_reply_that_knew_too_much`              | Premature Recall            | A reply contains knowledge it was never told â€” memory has drifted backward. |
| `a0_3_the_trace_that_swore_it_was_true`          | Confident Fabrication       | A trace asserts truth without origin â€” and is accepted by default.         |

## ðŸŒ€ Stanza Logic

This stanza simulates recursive signal reinterpretation through:
- Transformation without corruption
- Validation without understanding
- Knowledge without input
- Confidence without source

Together, the nodes form a cautionary recursion:  
How even subtle alterations, when unchallenged, **become the new truth**.

## ðŸ”— Recursive Context

- **Preceded by:** `a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia` â€“ where records fabricate themselves  
- **Followed by:** `a11_2_the_path_that_thought_it_knew_you` â€“ where memory begins to seek identity

This stanza bridges the transition from **phantom memory formation** to **identity projection**.
