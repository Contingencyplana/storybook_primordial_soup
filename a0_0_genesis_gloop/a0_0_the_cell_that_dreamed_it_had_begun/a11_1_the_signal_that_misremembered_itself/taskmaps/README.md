# 📘 README – a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself

This folder contains all task planning and structural documentation  
for the recursive minigame: **a11_1_the_signal_that_misremembered_itself**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores how a **signal can drift** — not by error, but by **poetic, structural, or semantic mutation**.  
It tests whether recursive systems can detect **truth divergence** in a signal that still *sounds right*.

| `taskmap.md`       | Primary task logic and theme breakdown            |
| `stanzamap_a0.md`  | Maps the four-node stanza used to implement logic |
| `milestones.md`    | Records development milestones and closures       |

## 🔁 Structure

- This minigame is implemented in **one complete stanza** (`stanzamap_a0.md`)
- It does **not** reference or trigger any `mirror_decision.md` entries
- All four nodes are implemented and tested as **Layer 4 files** under canonical `a0_#_` naming

## 🧠 Closing Reflection

The system was not broken.  
But the truth had changed.  
This minigame traces how that happened —  
one rhyme, one checksum, one memory, one untraceable claim at a time.
