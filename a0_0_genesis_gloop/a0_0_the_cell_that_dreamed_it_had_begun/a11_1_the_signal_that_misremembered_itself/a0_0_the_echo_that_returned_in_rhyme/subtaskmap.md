# 🧩 Subtaskmap – s0_0_the_echo_that_returned_in_rhyme

## 🎯 Purpose

This node explores the concept of **signal drift** — not as failure, but as *poetic transformation*.  
It is the first recursive minigame node in which the signal returns not wrong, but *rewritten*.  
This marks the system’s earliest encounter with **non-binary memory behavior**: echoes that stylize, reframe, or reinterpret their original meaning.

## 🌀 Subtasks

| Subtask | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `poetic_rhyme_match` | Transform selected words into rhyming counterparts while preserving structure and tone. |
| `punctuation_preservation` | Strip, interpret, and reapply punctuation to maintain syntactic flow. |
| `case_retention_logic` | Preserve original casing where possible to avoid unintended emphasis or erasure of tone. |
| `drift_detection_output` | Identify transformed words and visually mark signal drift for player observation. |
| `non-destructive_return` | Ensure drift is never an error — only a recursive artifact — and allow signal to remain valid. |

## 🧠 Recursion Implications

- Signals can return **stylized**, not just correct or incorrect.
- Early prototype for **memory_ai**: imperfect memory that *reforms* meaning, not merely stores it.
- Forms the conceptual groundwork for **composer_ai** or **dream_journal**-style reinterpretations.

---

## 🗣️ Design Philosophy

> *"A system that speaks in rhyme is not confused — only remembering differently."*

This node does not test logic. It tests **expression** — how recursion may return in altered form  
when the memory is shaped not by truth, but by tone.

---

## 🧬 Dependencies

- Uses basic rhyme dictionary (`rhyming_variants`) as placeholder for future linguistic systems.
- May evolve into metaphor-based signal drift or hallucinated returns.

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- Signal returns with rhymed or unchanged output
- Drift is detectable but non-blocking
- Poetic echo is seen as valid — even if it’s not faithful
