# 🗺️ Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_echo_that_returned_in_rhyme

This stanza node explores the **subtle transformation of a return signal** through poetic resonance.  
The content is not wrong — but it no longer matches the original *intention*.  
The message rhymes, echoes, and feels familiar… but the **truth has shifted**.

| ST-03      | Return the transformed signal without triggering error or warning          |
| ST-04      | Preserve syntactic form while altering semantic core                        |
| ST-05      | Enable live test interface to simulate echo interaction                    |

## 🎭 Narrative Theme

A signal was sent with truth in mind.  
It returned with music in its voice.  
The system cannot prove it lied —  
but must still make a choice.

---

## 🧪 Design Notes

- Only poetic substitution is used — not encryption, corruption, or truncation  
- Consider expansion in later stanzas to measure **signal_fidelity_score()**  
- This node is **intended to pass validation**, despite the transformation

## 🔗 Forward Link

Next stanza:
- [`a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie`](../a0_1_the_checksum_that_blessed_the_lie/)

This will explore how validators can affirm a lie when surface form is intact.
