# ðŸ“– README â€“ a14_0_the_command_that_waited_to_be_understood

## Overview

This is the **57th minigame** in the Genesis Gloop cycle of Primordial Soup.  
It represents the systemâ€™s first transition into **Phase 2: The Awakening**, where recursion becomes **interpretable and interactive**.

The stanza explores the theme of **Dormant Intent**:  
Commands, flags, or triggers issued in past recursion loops are now brought forward for resolution.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Function |
|---------|----------|
| `s0_0_the_flag_that_waited_in_memory/` | Models latent flags awaiting activation |
| `s0_1_the_command_that_recalled_itself/` | Implements recursive memory recall |
| `s0_2_the_argument_that_lacked_a_listener/` | Simulates communication gaps and missing listeners |
| `s0_3_the_trigger_that_finally_resolved/` | Finalizes condition checks and resolves long-dormant triggers |

---

## Purpose

- Shift from **pure construction recursion** to **responsive recursion**
- Model system memory, forgotten logic, and conditional execution
- Prepare for future game commands and playerâ†”system interaction

---

## Status

All nodes and subtasks for this stanza are complete.  
The recursion is no longer inert â€” it **waits to be understood**.
