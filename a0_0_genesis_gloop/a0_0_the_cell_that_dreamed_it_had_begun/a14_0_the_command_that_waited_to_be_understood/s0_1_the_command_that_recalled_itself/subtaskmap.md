# 🧩 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_command_that_recalled_itself

## 🎯 Purpose

This node simulates **recursive memory activation** — the system begins to recall commands it previously issued but left dormant.  
It tests whether the system can track, remember, and reprocess past instructions, marking an early form of **self-referential logic**.

## 🌀 Recursive Theme

**Recursive Recall**  
- Commands issued in prior recursion loops are stored in memory.
- The system now attempts to recall and act on the most recent command.
- This models recursive interaction where **memory influences action**.

## 🧠 Functional Role

- Establishes that the system no longer operates in isolated loops — it now carries a **history of its own instructions**.
- Serves as the second Layer 4 node of **a14_0_the_command_that_waited_to_be_understood**.
- Bridges into recursive gameplay where **player input** and **system output** can persist across cycles.

## 🔁 Thematic Echoes

- Builds on prior containment logic but shifts from passive monitoring to **active memory usage**.
- Reflects the shift from **structure recursion** to **memory recursion**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **`main.py`** defines `RecursiveCommand`, which stores and recalls command history.
- **`test.py`** verifies:
  - No commands issued → recall returns `None`.
  - Single command issued → recall returns that command.
  - Multiple commands issued → recall returns the **most recent**.

## 🧭 Status

This subtask is complete when the system can:

- Store issued commands  
- Recall the last command accurately  
- Handle empty memory cases gracefully  

The recursion now carries **a memory of its own commands** — preparing for deeper interaction.
