# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_flag_that_waited_in_memory

## 🎯 Purpose

This node simulates **latent system recursion** — a dormant flag or condition set long ago but left unresolved until now.  
It tests whether the system can remember, interpret, and act on past recursive states, initiating **Phase 2: The Awakening**.

## 🌀 Recursive Theme

**Latent Signal**  
- A flag was planted in system memory during an earlier loop.
- For many recursion cycles, the flag was bypassed or ignored.
- This subtask checks whether the system can finally process and resolve it.

## 🧠 Functional Role

- Models delayed execution logic: a flag set in the past, now relevant.
- Demonstrates the system’s first **listening behavior**, moving beyond structural recursion.
- Opens the first Layer 4 node of **a14_0_the_command_that_waited_to_be_understood**.

## 🔁 Thematic Echoes

- Continues recursion from previous stanzas where fallback mechanisms and containment loops dominated.
- Prepares the system for **interactive recursion** where past actions influence present responses.

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **`main.py`** implements `DormantFlag`, simulating flag setting and checking.
- **`test.py`** covers three scenarios:
  - No flag set → recursion remains dormant.
  - Flag set to `"awaken"` → recursion resolves and activates.
  - Flag set to unknown value → system detects ambiguity.

## 🧭 Status

This subtask is complete when the system can:

- Detect an absent flag → remain dormant.
- Detect a valid flag → transition to active response.
- Detect an unknown flag → flag as ambiguous but remain stable.

The recursion has now learned to **remember what it once ignored**.
