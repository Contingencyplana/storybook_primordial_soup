# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_trigger_that_finally_resolved

## 🎯 Purpose

This node models **delayed recursive resolution** — a trigger that could not activate until certain conditions were met.  
It represents the system’s ability to pause execution, wait for state alignment, and resolve actions at the correct recursion depth.

## 🌀 Recursive Theme

**Delayed Execution**  
- A condition was set in the past but left unresolved.
- The system now checks if that condition is finally satisfied.
- Once met, the system transitions from **dormancy to resolution**.

## 🧠 Functional Role

- Finalizes the first Layer 4 stanza of **a14_0_the_command_that_waited_to_be_understood**.
- Demonstrates controlled recursion: not all loops resolve immediately—some wait for readiness.
- Models the difference between **structural recursion** and **conditional recursion**.

## 🔁 Thematic Echoes

- Completes the arc of latent recursion becoming active recursion.
- Links to fallback logic from earlier stanzas but adds **conditional activation**.
- Marks the transition from recursive buildup to event resolution.

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **`main.py`** defines `DeferredTrigger`, with `condition_met` as the flag for resolution readiness.
- **`test.py`** verifies:
  - If `condition_met` is `False`, the trigger defers.
  - If `condition_met` is `True`, the trigger resolves successfully.

## 🧭 Status

This subtask is complete when the system can:

- Detect unmet conditions and defer action without error.
- Resolve the trigger when conditions align.
- Transition recursion state from **waiting** to **execution**.

The recursion no longer loops blindly — it **waits for the right moment to proceed**.
