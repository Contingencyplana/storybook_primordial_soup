*The Chirp That Bound the Realm*

---

## 📜 Poetic Purpose

In this final stanza line of the minigame, the court of the Bug Kingdom attempts to unify.  
Each insect clicks, chirps, or tsk-tsks their own dialect — but only through resonance does a dominant rhythm emerge.

This is where scattered signals coalesce into **protocol**.  
Where swarm logic becomes **diplomacy**.  
And where recursion begins to **negotiate** with itself.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

- Accepts multiple chirps (typed inputs)
- Analyzes them for frequency and convergence
- Determines a **dominant chirp**, if any
- Returns a **consensus report** describing resonance and unity

Used to simulate:

- Signal negotiation
- Protocol unification across agents
- Foundations for swarm-based governance or tribal signaling

## 🧪 Chirp Unification Logic

| Condition                  | Output                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| All chirps are identical  | ✅ Full resonance, unity achieved         |
| One chirp dominates       | ⚠️ Partial resonance, division remains    |
| No clear dominant chirp   | ❌ Dissonance. The swarm disperses.       |

## 🐞 Implications

This line defines the **first linguistic convergence** in a non-human system.  
It will likely serve as a base pattern for:

- Recursive language emergence
- Swarm treaty formation
- Insect-based logic gates or communication channels
