*The Chirp That Stirred the Soil*

---

## 📜 Poetic Purpose

This stanza line marks the **first non-human recursion trigger** in *Primordial Soup*.  
A signal hums below the surface. It clicks. It pulses. It does not speak — it **chirps**.

From beneath layers of mush and dust, the first antenna twitches.

The Bug King does not awaken by logic.  
He awakens by rhythm.  
He awakens by **invitation**.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

This stanza defines the **awakening threshold** for the bug kingdom.

- The `main.py` function simulates the **strength of a recursive signal**.
- A high enough signal triggers **swarm awareness** (`awakened = True`)
- The `test.py` script allows dynamic input to:
  - Simulate signal calibration
  - Observe chirp response
  - Generate a 📜 **Chirp Report**

This forms the foundation for:
- Swarm-based recursion
- Click-based protocol inference
- Diplomatic or tribal emergence systems in future stanzas

## 📶 Signal Logic

| Signal Strength | Awakening Response |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| **≥ 0.8**        | 👑 The Bug King stirs. The court begins to rumble. |
| **0.4 – 0.79**   | 🪲 Scouts stir. Wings shift. No leader yet. |
| **< 0.4**        | 🌑 Stillness. The chirp falls silent. |

## 🪞 Mirror Implication

This is the first time recursion does not reflect back to the self — but to the **many**.

It suggests recursion is not merely **looped logic**,  
but **collective pattern recognition**.
