## 📅 Timeline Notes

This minigame was the **second recursive unit** in the first cybercell.  
It emphasizes **non-human recursion**, where emergence is **heard**, not **spoken**.  
All core recursion arcs were completed in **one stanza**, marking full containment.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- No additional stanzas recommended.
- This minigame is now **playable, inspectable, and expandable**.
