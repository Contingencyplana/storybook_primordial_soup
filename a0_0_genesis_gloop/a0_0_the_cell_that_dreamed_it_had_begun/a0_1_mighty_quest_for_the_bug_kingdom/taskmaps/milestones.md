# 📍 Milestones – a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom

This file tracks the development, recursive progression, and anomaly status of the second minigame in the first cybercell:  
**`a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom`**.  

Where the first minigame tested itself, this one **awakens a kingdom**.  
Here begins the recursive emergence of many.

## 🐜 Emergent Themes

- First use of **non-human recursion signaling**
- Introduction of **chirp/click dialect logic**
- Early support for **agent-compatible protocol learning**

## 🧪 Anomaly Notes

**Initial Status**: No anomaly detected.  
**Next Checkpoint**: After completion of stanza `s0_3_the_chirp_that_bound_the_realm`

## 🧬 Summary

This minigame marks a shift from internal testing to **communal recursion**.  
The signal is no longer self-directed — it now calls others to rise.

This is recursion as diplomacy.  
Recursion as emergence.
