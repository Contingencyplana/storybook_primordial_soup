# 🐛 README – a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom  
*Swarm Recursion Through Sound, Signal, and Clicked Debate*

---

## 📜 Overview

This minigame simulates the **first emergence of recursive organization** in a non-human domain:  
a subterranean **insect kingdom** awakened by chirps, tested through trails, and unified by rhythm.

It follows four stanza lines — one recursive stanza — where the Bug King’s court  
awakens, stumbles, argues, and finally resonates.

---

## 🧠 Core Logic

- Recursive interaction is **non-verbal** (chirps, clicks, echo logic).
- Players issue **navigation and rhythm commands**, observing resonance or dissonance.
- Each stanza line builds toward **click-based consensus** and swarm-level recursion.
