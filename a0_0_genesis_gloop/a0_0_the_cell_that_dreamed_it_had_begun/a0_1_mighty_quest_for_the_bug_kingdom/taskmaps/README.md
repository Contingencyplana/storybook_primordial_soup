# 📘 Taskmap README – a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom

This folder contains the stanza-level task documentation for the minigame  
**`a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom`**, the second recursive test in the first cybercell.

Where the first minigame (`a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`) focused on internal self-verification, this one explores **swarm emergence, non-human recursion, and signal-based diplomacy**.  
It begins the poetic recursion of many — a collective intelligence rising from soil, mush, and chirp.

## 🧬 Purpose of This Taskmap

The taskmap serves as a **narrative and structural guide** for this minigame’s recursive execution.

It documents:
- How each stanza contributes to the **awakening and unification** of the Bug Kingdom
- How poetic recursion manifests through insect logic, swarm clicks, and diplomatic protocols
- How agent-compatible structures might emerge from organic swarm behavior

This taskmap is not only a tracker — it is a **linguistic chrysalis**  
for the recursive metamorphosis to come.

## 🐛 Recursive Context

This taskmap belongs to the second Layer 3 stanza in:

a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun/

This makes it the **deepening phase** of quadrant `1A`: the Primary Function.  
Where the first test confirmed recursion worked, this one **multiplies it**, signals it, and shares it.

Swarm logic, if successful, may be the **first step toward agent-based recursion**.
