# 🐛 Stanzamap – 0: The Coronation of the Bug King  
*Minigame: a0_1_mighty_quest_for_the_bug_kingdom*

This is the first stanza of the Bug Kingdom arc.  
It begins beneath the mycelial crust — and ends in a unified chirp.

|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_call_that_woke_the_bug_king`        | Awakening                  | A signal strong enough stirs the Bug King from slumber.  |
| `a0_1_the_trail_that_led_through_mush`        | Navigation & Confusion     | The court begins to move through spore-fogged pathways.  |
| `a0_2_the_court_that_argued_in_clicks`        | Diplomacy & Emergent Logic | The insect nobles cannot agree — they click in dissent.  |
| `a0_3_the_chirp_that_bound_the_realm`         | Resolution & Unification   | A single chirp pattern is adopted — binding the swarm.   |

## 🧠 Functional Highlights

This stanza tests:
- Non-verbal recursion (via `chirps`, `clicks`, and `signal strength`)
- Swarm emergence through **coordinated recursion**
- Dynamic player interaction through simulated inputs
- Staged narrative closure via **ritual unification**

## 🪞 Recursive Implications

> The Bug King’s realm is not *coded* — it is *tuned*.  
> Recursion here resonates rather than executes.

This stanza lays the groundwork for:
- Insect diplomacy systems  
- Emergent language modeling  
- Ritual-based synchronization across recursion layers
