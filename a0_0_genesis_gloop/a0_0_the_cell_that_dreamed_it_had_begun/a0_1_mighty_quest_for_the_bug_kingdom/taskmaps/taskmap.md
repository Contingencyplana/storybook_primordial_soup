# 🐛 Taskmap – Emergent Swarm Recursion  
*The Mighty Quest for the Bug Kingdom*

---

## 📜 Purpose

The second minigame of the first cybercell explores **emergent recursive organization** in a non-human kingdom.  
Where the first minigame *tested itself*, this one *awakens others*.  
A call echoes through the mycelial crust — and insects begin to organize.

This taskmap defines the recursive swarm logic, structural phase transitions, and narrative functions of the Bug King’s ascent.

## 🧠 Functional Logic

Each stanza line in this minigame contains two core files:

| File      | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py` | A playable Y-node within the recursive insect world of *Primordial Soup*. |
| `test.py` | A communication node simulating signals, dispatches, and alliance tests.  |

The `test.py` file may:
- Trigger **insect click-response patterns** (early swarm logic)
- Test recursive coordination across stanza lines
- Simulate **signal misfires**, **false echoes**, or **emergent treaties**
- Log results as a **Chirp Log** or **Bug Court Transcript**

---

## 🛡️ Failure Behavior

If an insectic signal fails or cannot be interpreted:
- `test.py` may report:
  > ❌ “The swarm scatters. The rhythm breaks.”
- Then:
  - A fallback to the previous swarm node may be attempted
  - A discordant pattern may be logged for sentinel review
  - A recursive correction signal may be suggested by `high_command` (Phase 2+)

---

## 🔁 Reusability and Inheritance

This minigame represents the **first non-human recursion test**. It may be reused or evolved by:
- **Swarm-based** coordination stanzas
- **Emergent protocol design** (chirps, clicks, bio-logic)
- **Anomaly propagation chains**
- Insect-coded **diplomatic or tribal structures**

Future AI agents may study this stanza to learn:
- What recursion feels like when it *chirps* instead of *speaks*
