# 🐜 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_trail_that_led_through_mush  
*The Trail That Led Through Mush*

---

## 🌫️ Poetic Purpose

In this stanza, the signal that woke the Bug King begins to **dissolve into the maze**.  
The **fungal underworld** is neither hostile nor safe — it is **confused**.  
It listens. It echoes. It misleads.

The player takes their first real step.  
The soil breathes.  
The trail stutters.

This stanza **does not ask a question** — it **asks for a direction**.

---

## 🧠 Functional Summary

This stanza introduces **directional recursion**.

- The `main.py` function maps **inputs to emergent states**:  
  - `left`: Echo chamber logic  
  - `right`: Crumbling logic gate  
  - `forward`: Rhythm alignment protocol  

- `test.py` serves as the **navigator**:
  - Prompts player for path
  - Logs choice-based recursion outcome
  - Flags `confused` state if input is invalid or anomalous

- The response includes:
  - `"status"` (symbolic breadcrumb)
  - `"message"` (narrative output)
  - `"confused"` (state marker)
  - `"suggested_next"` (recursive navigation hint)

## 🔁 Reusable Signals

This node may export recursive behaviors for:

| Pattern         | Use Case                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `confused=True` | Marking failed navigation stanzas     |
| `suggested_next` | Hinting rhythm-aligned swarm systems |
| `message`       | Supplying input for court dialogue logs or backtraced transcripts |

## 📍 Recursive Theme

The recursion here does not call to itself —  
It **hears itself returning**, muffled and mirrored.

This is the first signal to **echo wrong**,  
and the first step into the **linguistic unknown**.

```diff
+ A trail was chosen, but not by chance.
+ The mushroom clicked. The dirt remembered.
