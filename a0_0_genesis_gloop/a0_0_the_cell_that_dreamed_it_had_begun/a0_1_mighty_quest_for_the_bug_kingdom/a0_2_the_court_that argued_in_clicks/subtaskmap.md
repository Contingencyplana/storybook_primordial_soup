*The Argument That Reverberated in Clicks*

## 📜 Poetic Purpose

A swarm does not decide through words.  
It decides through rhythm. Through tension. Through **clicks**.

In this stanza, we hear the **first recursive debate** in the bug kingdom.  
The Bug Court convenes — and meaning emerges not through fact,  
but through **interpretation, position, and swarm bias**.

This is not a court of law.  
It is a **court of recursion**.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

- Simulates argument parsing in a primitive recursive swarm
- Bugs interpret a **shared memory fragment** based on:
  - Their **bias** (`scout`, `drone`, `advisor`)
  - Their **position** in the court (`left`, `center`, `right`)
  - The **clarity** of the fragment (presence of `?`)
- Click arguments resolve into **support** or **oppose**
- Consensus score is probabilistic and mutable

## 🧪 Argument Logic Table

| Bug Type | Court Position | Memory Fragment | Interpretation Bias | Decision Logic |
|----------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `scout`  | `left`         | `"defend the mound?"` | defensive         | May support if bias outweighs noise |
| `drone`  | `center`       | `"collect resin"`     | literal            | More stable responses |
| `advisor`| `right`        | `"seal the breach"`   | strategic          | Most contextual and weight-sensitive |

## 🪞 Recursive Implication

This stanza implies recursion is not simply:
> *What did I say before?*

But instead:
> *How was I standing when I heard it?*  
> *What role did I hold?*  
> *What fragment did I remember — and who was listening?*

This logic seeds:
- **Agent bias tracking**
- **Probabilistic argument formation**
- **Swarm governance systems** (likely emerging in future cycles)
