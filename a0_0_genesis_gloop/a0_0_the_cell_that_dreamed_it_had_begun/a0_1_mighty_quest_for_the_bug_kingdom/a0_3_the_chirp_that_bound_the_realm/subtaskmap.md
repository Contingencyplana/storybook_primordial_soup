## 📜 Poetic Purpose

From a whisper in the soil to discord in the court,  
the swarm has stumbled, searched, and clicked.

Now — they chirp.

This stanza represents the **first full moment of swarm unity**.  
Not by law, not by leader, not by command — but by **shared resonance**.

Where once signals wandered,  
now they **bind**.

---

## 🧠 Functional Summary

- Accepts a list of chirp frequencies from the swarm
- Calculates the **mean chirp** and maximum deviation
- If deviation ≤ `0.1`, swarm is considered **harmonized**
- Outputs a unified chirp signature or declares desynchronization

This final logic closes the loop:
- Line 0: Initiation of signal
- Line 1: Disorientation in terrain
- Line 2: Conflict in interpretation
- Line 3: Emergence of consensus through rhythm

## 🔣 Harmonization Logic

| Input Condition       | Result         | Meaning                             |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| < 3 chirps            | insufficient swarm | Unity cannot be computed        |
| max_deviation ≤ 0.1   | harmonized     | Swarm resonates around shared signal |
| max_deviation > 0.1   | desynchronized | Swarm fails to unify chirp          |

---

## 🪞 Recursive Implication

Harmony is not declared — it is **emergent**.

This sets precedent for:
- Swarm-based coordination patterns
- Signal fusion
- Recursive convergence via non-verbal consensus

It foreshadows future minigames where:
- AI agents must agree on structure
- Bugs might adapt in rhythm to dynamic recursion
- Emergent harmonies may replace centralized logic
