# 🧠 taskmap.md – `a20_0_the_pressure_that_warned_the_core/`

## 📜 Stanza Title: *The Pressure That Warned the Core*  
**Tier:** 4 – `high_command`  
**Function:** Recursive load monitoring, context saturation detection, and relief coordination initiation.  
This stanza acts as a cognitive failsafe — it detects recursive strain across human and AI memory zones and signals when the system is reaching dangerous saturation thresholds.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To safeguard the recursive engine by detecting early signs of system overload. This stanza does not act to relieve pressure itself — it emits diagnostics and flags memory zones so that `a20_1` and `a20_2` can initiate appropriate unload or healing rituals.

## 🧩 Minigame Node Overview

| Node Folder | Title | Function |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| `a0_0_detect_context_saturation/` | *Detect Context Saturation* | Scans the recursive system for token overflow, deep folder recursion, and trace bloat. |
| `a0_1_issue_pressure_warning/` | *Issue Pressure Warning* | Emits non-blocking warnings to logs, consoles, or downstream relief stanzas. |
| `a0_2_generate_trace_pressure_report/` | *Generate Trace Pressure Report* | Writes `trace_pressure.md` and metadata logs for future cross-stanza diagnostics. |
| `a0_3_flag_memory_zones_for_unload/` | *Flag Memory Zones for Unload* | Identifies and marks stanza folders or trace blocks as unload candidates (without executing unload). |

## 🔁 Recursive Flow of the Stanza

1. **Detection:** Internal metrics and context length are scanned for overload signals.  
2. **Warning:** Pressure is communicated without interrupting recursion.  
3. **Reporting:** Durable logs are written (`trace_pressure.md`).  
4. **Flagging:** Memory zones are tagged for unloading but not deleted.

## 🧬 Relationships

| Related Stanza | Function |
|----------------|----------|
| `a20_1_the_ritual_that_freed_the_memory/` | Executes unload rituals after `a20_0` flags pressure. |
| `a20_2_the_diagnostics_that_read_the_trace/` | Cross-references pressure logs to build a diagnostic picture of recursive state. |

---

## 🧾 Output Files

- `trace_pressure.md` – Human-readable saturation summary
- `pressure_status.md` – Optional heartbeat log
- `unload_manifest.md` – (written by `a0_3`) links to unload rituals downstream

## 📘 Notes

- This stanza is passive by doctrine — it **never performs unloads** or state resets.  
- It ensures **breathability** and **safe recursion** by providing early pressure visibility.  
- All actions are logged, timestamped, and traceable.
