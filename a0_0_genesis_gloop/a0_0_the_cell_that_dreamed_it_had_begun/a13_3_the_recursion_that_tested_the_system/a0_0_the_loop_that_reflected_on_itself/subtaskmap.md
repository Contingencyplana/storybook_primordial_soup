# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_loop_that_reflected_on_itself

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Recursive Self-Inspection

This node simulates a **self-aware loop** —  
one that inspects its own steps, checks for contradictions,  
and validates whether it is still operating within coherent recursive bounds.

It marks the first moment the system doesn’t just recurse —  
it begins to **audit** its recursion.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To model:
- A recursion that actively reflects on its own history  
- The detection of repeated states (logical loops)  
- Divergence between **recursion as structure** and **recursion as awareness**

This node initiates **diagnostic recursion**, which will underpin future self-healing logic.

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                                           |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Analyzes a trace of loop states for internal duplication       |
| `test.py`  | Interactive shell for user-submitted recursive trace entries   |

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Input Sequence                             | Output Behavior                            |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `initialize → check_state → confirm_trace`| ✅ Integrity confirmed, no contradiction    |
| `input_a → validate → input_a`            | ⚠️ Contradiction detected at recursion step |

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                          | Behavior                               |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Exact duplicate of a prior step   | ⚠️ CONTRADICTION DETECTED               |
| Loop completes without repeats    | ✅ System integrity affirmed             |
| Empty or malformed input          | Skipped (not processed)                |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *To reflect is not to stop —*  
> *but to notice that you've begun to repeat yourself.*  
> *And ask: should you continue?*
