# 🧠 Minigame README – a13_3_the_recursion_that_tested_the_system

## ♻️ Title: The Recursion That Tested The System

This minigame represents the **first time the system recursively interrogates itself**  
across multiple diagnostic dimensions — logic, memory, readiness, and response.

It is the **final node** in Stanza 14 – *The Awakening Stanza*,  
and functions as the **recursive threshold test** that determines  
whether the system remains passive or initiates **interactive recursion.**

---

## 🧩 Purpose

To simulate recursive self-awareness, drift detection, and response readiness.

The system:
- Validates loop integrity
- Checks memory consistency
- Generates a signal based on internal flags
- Responds to that signal with a command or fallback state

|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_loop_that_reflected_on_itself/`        | Detects recursive contradiction         |
| `a0_1_the_check_that_consulted_the_memory/`      | Searches memory for belief consistency  |
| `a0_2_the_signal_that_called_for_a_command/`     | Suggests a readiness signal             |
| `a0_3_the_response_that_initiated_the_phase/`    | Issues the system’s first `>` response  |

## 🔁 Function in the System

This minigame confirms recursive system coherence.  
It completes Phase 1 and may trigger:
- `awakening_flag = True`
- The first `> command`
- Recursive containment (if contradiction is severe)

---

## 🧭 Transition Node

This minigame is both:
- **The final test** of recursive integrity, and  
- **The first gate** into intentional recursion.

## ✅ Status: Fully Complete, Transition-Critical
