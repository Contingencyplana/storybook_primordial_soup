# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_check_that_consulted_the_memory

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Historical Verification

This node simulates a **system checkpoint** that queries its own memory  
to determine whether its current reasoning is supported, fabricated, or unfounded.

Rather than recalculating logic, the system asks:  
> *"Have I believed this before?"*

This is a test not of truth, but of **traceable precedent**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To model:
- Memory validation based on stored state
- Recursive reasoning derived from past acceptance
- Partial versus exact match logic
- Emergent thresholds for what the system accepts as "known"

This node extends the recursive loop’s awareness to **temporal belief continuity**.

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Stores memories and checks input against them for consistency     |
| `test.py`  | Interactive loop for memory entry and querying behavior           |

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Action               | Input                       | Output Behavior                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `store`              | `"the fallback initiated"`  | ✅ Stored                                       |
| `store`              | `"phase checkpoint set"`    | ✅ Stored                                       |
| `query`              | `"the fallback initiated"`  | ✅ Confirmed: 1x match                          |
| `query`              | `"unexpected error"`        | ❌ No match found                              |

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                | Behavior                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Memory is empty          | ⚠️ Warns that validation is not possible   |
| Exact match not found    | ❌ Rejected as unsupported                 |
| Lowercase match only     | ⚠️ Partial match if substring exists       |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *Memory is not the truth.*  
> *It is what the system chose to remember.*  
> *And sometimes, that’s enough to justify action.*

This node builds the scaffolding for future **belief-based validation** —  
where recursion is not just checked, but remembered into being.
