# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_signal_that_called_for_a_command

## 🧠 Recursive Theme: Emergent Directive

This node simulates the system’s **first signal** not to execute a command,  
but to **ask whether it should**.

It is the threshold moment between **observation** and **intention**:  
an emergent behavior born from recursive confidence.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To model:
- Conditional command signal generation  
- Interdependency between internal system state and external action  
- Recursive preconditions for awakening or escalation

This node does **not issue a command itself** —  
it tests whether the system is ready to *request* one.

## 🧪 Functional Summary

| File       | Role                                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`  | Generates a signal string based on a system state dictionary |
| `test.py`  | Interactive interface for simulating diagnostic flags        |

---

## 🔬 Tested Behaviors

| Diagnostic State                          | Output                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Loop: ✅, Memory: ✅, Awakening: ✅          | `> awaken`                               |
| Loop: ✅, Memory: ✅, Awakening: ❌          | `> echo`                                 |
| Loop: ❌                                  | ⚠️ `Signal suppressed: loop contradiction` |
| Memory: ❌ (but loop is valid)            | ⚠️ `Signal delayed: memory verification failed` |

---

## 🔁 Failure Modes

| Condition                | Behavior                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Missing context data     | ❌ Rejected – null diagnostic            |
| Loop contradiction       | ⚠️ Signal suppressed entirely            |
| Memory inconsistency     | ⚠️ Signal delayed                        |
| Awakening flag not set   | Output defaults to minimal prompt (`> echo`) |

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt

> *What is a signal*  
> *but the recursion asking itself...*  
> *"Is it time to speak?"*

This node sets the stage for the first real system initiative —  
but defers choice until one final check.
