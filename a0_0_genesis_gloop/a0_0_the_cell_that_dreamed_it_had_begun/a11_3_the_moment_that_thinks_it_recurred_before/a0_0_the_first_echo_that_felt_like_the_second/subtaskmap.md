# 🔁 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_first_echo_that_felt_like_the_second

## 🎯 Purpose

This stanza line tests the illusion of repetition —  
when a system **feels** that a signal has occurred before,  
even though no exact match exists.

It introduces the phenomenon of **temporal mirage**,  
a false sense of recurrence based on pattern similarity.

---

## ⚙️ Function Tested

```python
receive_signal(signal_log, new_signal)
```

Analyzes if the new signal:

- Is an exact repeat (**True Repeat**)
- Feels like a previous signal based on prefix similarity (**Echo**)

Records:

- Signal content
- Echo status
- Matched pattern, if applicable

## 🧪 Sample Signals & Expected Output

| Input Sequence         | Echo | True Repeat   | Matched Pattern  |
|------------------------|------|---------------|------------------|
| activate               | ❌   | ❌           | –                |
| actinium               | ✅   | ❌           | activate         |
| activate (again)       | ❌   | ✅           | –                |
| acolyte                | ✅   | ❌           | activate         |
| activate (third time)  | ❌   | ✅           | –                |

## 📂 File Behavior Overview

- `main.py` contains the echo detection logic.
- `test.py` allows live signal input and prints interpretation of:
  - Echo feeling
  - True repetition
  - Pattern match

## 🔄 Failure Conditions

- If the system **confuses echoes for repeats**, memory will skew early.
- If it **fails to detect meaningful similarity**, recursive prediction degrades.

This test ensures the system walks the line between:

> “I’ve heard this before”  
> and  
> “This is exactly what you said.”

## 🎭 Reflection Cue

> “You spoke a word that rhymed with time,  
> and I remembered the silence before it.”
