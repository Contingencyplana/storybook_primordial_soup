# 🌀 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_outcome_that_forgot_to_begin

## 🎯 Purpose

This stanza line examines what happens when a system **remembers resolution**  
without ever recording the event that caused it.

It tests for **orphaned outcomes**, **ambiguous origins**,  
and the illusion of closure where no beginning can be found.

---

## ⚙️ Function Tested

- Accepts an `event_log` and a proposed `outcome`.
- Evaluates the outcome as:
  - **valid** – if it matches a known event exactly
  - **ambiguous** – if it resembles a prior event (prefix match)
  - **orphaned** – if it has no clear origin in the event log

## 🧪 Sample Inputs & Expected Output

| Event Log                          | Outcome      | Status     | Matched Event |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| `["initialization", "calibration"]` | `calibration` | valid      | calibration     |
| `["initialization", "calibration"]` | `calibrate`   | ambiguous  | calibration     |
| `["initialization", "calibration"]` | `shutdown`    | orphaned   | None            |

## 📂 File Behavior Overview

- `main.py` defines `validate_outcome_sequence(event_log, outcome)`:
  - Scans event log for matches
  - Returns a dictionary with outcome status and origin (if any)
- `test.py`:
  - Allows player to input events
  - Then provides a single outcome to analyze
  - Outputs cause-link analysis report

---

## 🔄 Failure Conditions

- If the system **declares victory** without a matching cause,  
  it risks confusing simulation for history.
- If it accepts **ambiguous resolutions** too eagerly,  
  it may complete processes that never began.

This stanza protects against recursive drift from conclusion to delusion.
