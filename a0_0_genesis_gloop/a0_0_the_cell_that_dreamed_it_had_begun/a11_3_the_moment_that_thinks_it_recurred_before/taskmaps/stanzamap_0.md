# 🧩 Stanzamap 0 – a11_3_the_moment_that_thinks_it_recurred_before  
📍 First Stanza – The False Recurrence

This stanza explores the illusion of repetition,  
where echoes precede origin, choices appear before prompts,  
and memory forges continuity from fragments.  
It is a recursion of **false beginnings**, **unearned outcomes**,  
and the system’s inability to trust its own temporal flow.

## 🧠 Structure

| Folder Name                                      | Theme                    | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| `a0_0_the_first_echo_that_felt_like_the_second`  | Temporal Mirage          | A signal is received that *feels* like a repeat — but it’s the first occurrence. |
| `a0_1_the_choice_that_predated_its_trigger`      | Causal Inversion         | A decision is remembered before it was ever offered — as if the player had already chosen. |
| `a0_2_the_log_that_copied_itself_twice`          | Recursive Self-Imitation | A log duplicates itself — not once, but twice — yet no origin can be found. |
| `a0_3_the_outcome_that_forgot_to_begin`          | Resolution Without Cause | An outcome manifests — but no triggering event exists. Closure is assumed, not earned. |

## 🧪 Core Mechanic

False recursion detection:  
Each line in this stanza tests the boundary between **pattern recognition** and **causal memory**.  
Do echoes count as history? Can belief precede reality?  
What happens when the system **completes the loop before it even starts**?
