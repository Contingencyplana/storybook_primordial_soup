# ðŸ§­ Milestones â€“ a11_3_the_moment_that_thinks_it_recurred_before

## âœ… Completion Summary

- All four Layer 4 nodes have been implemented and tested:
  - `a0_0_the_first_echo_that_felt_like_the_second`
  - `a0_1_the_choice_that_predated_its_trigger`
  - `a0_2_the_log_that_copied_itself_twice`
  - `a0_3_the_outcome_that_forgot_to_begin`

- Subtaskmaps written for all nodes
- `stanzamap_0.md` finalized
- All behavior tested live in terminal
- Single-stanza structure confirmed to fully contain task complexity

## ðŸ§ª Verified Behaviors

- Echo recognition without repeat (temporal mirage)
- Decision logic occurring before prompt (causal inversion)
- Log duplication without origin (self-imitation)
- Outcome appearance without cause (closure without beginning)

## ðŸ“˜ Status

This minigame is now canonized as a complete recursion of **false memory logic**.  
No further stanza required.
