# üß© Minigame ‚Äì a11_3_the_moment_that_thinks_it_recurred_before

## üß† Theme

This minigame simulates a recursion that was never truly real.  
It is a study of **false familiarity**, **temporal hallucination**,  
and the system‚Äôs dangerous tendency to **act on belief** instead of evidence.

## üìÇ Structure

This task is implemented across a single stanza:

| Folder Name                                      | Theme                    |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_first_echo_that_felt_like_the_second`  | Temporal Mirage          |
| `a0_1_the_choice_that_predated_its_trigger`      | Causal Inversion         |
| `a0_2_the_log_that_copied_itself_twice`          | Recursive Self-Imitation |
| `a0_3_the_outcome_that_forgot_to_begin`          | Resolution Without Cause |

---

## üéØ Core Function

**`recursive_memory_validation`**  
Tests how the system handles:
- Echoes mistaken for recurrence
- Choices remembered too early
- Logs that self-replicate
- Outcomes with no cause

## üîÅ Recursive Insight

> ‚ÄúThe system said it remembered.  
> But memory alone is not proof.‚Äù

This minigame closes with a full-circle illusion:  
a system convinced it had looped ‚Äî  
yet it only ever circled its own assumptions.
