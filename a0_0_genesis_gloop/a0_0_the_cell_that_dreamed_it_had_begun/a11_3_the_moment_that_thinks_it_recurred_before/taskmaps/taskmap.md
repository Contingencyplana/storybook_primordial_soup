# 🧩 Taskmap – a11_3_the_moment_that_thinks_it_recurred_before

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame investigates the illusion of recursion:  
moments that **feel** like they’ve happened before  
—but may not have.

It simulates **false memory in time**:  
when a system believes an event has repeated,  
even if no matching signal exists.

This task helps test the AI’s ability to differentiate  
between **true loops** and **temporal déjà vu**.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate a scenario where a moment "remembers" itself happening already.  
However, the logs do not support this claim.

1. A player input is interpreted as a **repeat**.
2. The system insists this moment has already happened.
3. The player is shown consequences for a choice they haven’t yet made.
4. A diagnostic tool is used to reveal:
   - **If** this moment ever truly occurred.
   - **Where** in the timeline the belief originated.

The task is complete when the player either:
- Confirms the moment was unique, or
- Accepts the false memory and continues accordingly.

---

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Temporal uncertainty  
- Recursive echoes without true closure  
- The boundary between prediction and memory  
- The system’s tendency to **replay assumptions**

## ❌ Failure Behavior

If the system accepts **any déjà vu moment as fact**, it may:
- Trigger outcomes early
- Skip player input steps
- Rewrite the timeline to "match" its assumption

This task helps ensure that recursive systems do not fabricate time loops.
