# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_check_that_expected_a_signal

## 🧠 Purpose

This node tests **presumptive validation logic** — the dangerous belief that a signal *will* arrive and *must* be valid.  
It simulates a system that checks eagerly and prematurely, highlighting what happens when assumptions are embedded in logic paths.

This stanza builds directly on s0_0’s silence, asking:  
> *What if the system breaks not from absence, but from the expectation that something was always meant to be there?*

## ⚙️ Subtasks

| Subtask                                | Status  | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| Raise custom error on `None`           | ✅ Pass | Returns: `"Expected a signal, but none was received."` |
| Raise error for empty or blank string  | ✅ Pass | Returns: `"Received an empty or blank signal."` |
| Detect and reject non-string input     | ✅ Pass | Returns: `"Signal received is not a string."` |
| Accept valid string input              | ✅ Pass | Allows recursive handoff to next logic stage |
| Fix type-check ordering edge case      | ✅ Fixed | Early `strip()` on integer caused crash; resolved via reordered guards |

## 🔬 Reflections

- Assumptions baked into validation logic can easily cause exceptions, especially when external input is involved.
- Systems should be resilient to type violations, silence, and semantic emptiness.
- This node now safely guards against all three — a defensive structure for higher recursion.

## 🔗 Recursive Implications

- Echoes the logic in `s0_0`, but with **active expectation** rather than passive listening.
- Failures here might link to `s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain`, where the response handler never sees a validated signal.
- Patterns here could be reused in **sentinel escalation**, **recursive validation chains**, or **command-and-control parsing**.
