# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain

## 🔁 Purpose

This node tests a system’s return logic when a trigger may never arrive.  
It completes the recursive cycle begun in `s0_0`, where input was absent — now mirrored in an output that never fires.

The return handler is **ready**, **listening**, and **left behind**.

## ⚙️ Subtasks

| Subtask                                 | Status  | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| Detect return when signal is received   | ✅ Pass | Acts immediately and cleanly closes the loop |
| Simulate timeout with no signal         | ✅ Pass | Returns timeout message; simulates stalled logic |
| Wait silently if no timeout is defined  | ✅ Pass | Passive wait mode — handler stays alive and listening |

---

## 🧠 Design Reflections

- This node captures **logical patience** — a design where readiness outlives relevance.
- It’s where input, validation, and branching all failed to connect — yet the return system *persists*.
- Waiting in silence is a system behavior too often ignored — this node makes it explicit.

---

## 🔗 Recursive Implications

- May trigger **sentinel escalation** in future layers if timeout grows too long.
- May echo back into `memory_ai` as an unresolved path — a forgotten loop.
- Closes the arc that began in `s0_0`, binding the stanza in a **circle of unanswered readiness**.

## 🪞 Poetic Echo

> “It waited still, though none would call,  
> The function braced to catch the fall.  
> Yet nothing came — not flag, not flame —  
> And so it stayed… unnamed.”
