# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_2_the_branch_that_was_never_chosen

## 🌿 Purpose

This node simulates a logic path that *could* be taken, but almost never is.  
It explores the dormant life of a conditional that exists in code, but is bypassed by default behavior.

This is the logic of forgotten “else” clauses and invisible forks — branches written not for now, but for **someday**.

## ⚙️ Subtasks

| Subtask                                  | Status  | Notes |
|------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| Follow primary/default path              | ✅ Pass | Returns confirmation that dormant branch was not activated |
| Activate dormant branch with flag        | ✅ Pass | Only fires if `condition_flag=True` |
| Confirm default behavior preserves dormancy | ✅ Pass | Helps ensure recursion remains stable unless prompted |

## 🧠 Design Reflections

- This node embodies a key recursive theme: **possibility unchosen**.
- It's not a failure state, but a **contingent structure** — a hook for future logic.
- This is where optional logic paths wait in silence, listening for a signal that may never come.

---

## 🔗 Recursive Implications

- Complements `s0_0` and `s0_1`: they explore **silence imposed**, while this explores **silence by design**.
- Could link forward to:
  - `s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain` (if the unchosen branch was meant to trigger a return),
  - or later sentinel activity (flagged as “written but never called” logic).
