# ðŸ§­ Subtaskmap â€“ a0_0_the_input_that_was_never_given

## ðŸ§© Stanza Line: The Input That Was Never Given  
**Theme:** Absent Intent / Silent Transmission / Echo Interpretation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This stanza line tests how the system interprets **missing, ambiguous, or unstructured input**.  
It simulates a moment where **no request was made**, yet the system responds â€” either to silence, confusion, or poetic noise.

The goal is not to correct the player, but to allow the system to reflect meaning back, even when none was clearly expressed.

## ðŸ§ª Testable Input Conditions

| Input Type         | Example Input       | Expected Response                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty Input        | *(Enter pressed)*   | Status: `empty` â€“ "You said nothing. Yet the silence echoed like a question."     |
| Uncertain Input    | `?`, `help`, `what` | Status: `uncertain` â€“ "A question wrapped in fog. Clarify your echo."             |
| Ambiguous Input    | `the wind`          | Status: `received` â€“ "You gave: 'the wind'. The system stirred and listened."     |
| Exit Condition     | `exit`, `quit`, `q` | Ends the loop with a farewell message.                                            |

## ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

- **Non-input is not an error** â€” it is *an event*.
- The system reflects **perceived intent**, not just literal content.
- Even absence has agency in recursive play.

---

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

- `main.py` exposes `interpret_unasked_input()` as the Y-node logic.
- `test.py` provides an interactive prompt with built-in loop and exit triggers.
- Status codes (`empty`, `uncertain`, `received`) can be hooked to other stanza nodes in future systems.

## ðŸ”— Possible Follow-On Nodes

- `a0_1_the_loop_that_forgot_to_listen` â€“ responds to ignored input.
- `a0_2_the_response_that_was_already_waiting` â€“ anticipates a reply before the question arrives.
- `a0_3_the silence_that_answered_itself` â€“ explores recursive response to no response.
