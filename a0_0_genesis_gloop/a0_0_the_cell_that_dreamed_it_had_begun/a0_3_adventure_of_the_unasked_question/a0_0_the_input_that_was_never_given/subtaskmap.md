# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_0_the_input_that_was_never_given

## 🌑 Purpose

This node tests the system's behavior in the **complete absence of input**.

Rather than validating a typical decision tree, it explores how readiness persists without action, and how default or fallback logic activates (or doesn't) in silence.

This is the first echo in the minigame’s recursive cave — a prompt never uttered, yet still listened for.

## ⚙️ Subtasks

| Subtask                         | Status  | Notes |
|--------------------------------|---------|-------|
| Handle `None` input gracefully | ✅ Pass | Interpreted as silent wait |
| Handle empty string            | ✅ Pass | Detected and handled as non-signal |
| Distinguish whitespace-only    | ✅ Pass | Correctly labeled as meaningless |
| Accept valid input             | ✅ Pass | Passes control forward normally |
| Ensure no crash on inactivity  | ✅ Pass | System stays idle without errors |

## 🧠 Design Considerations

- Input is optional, but *expectation* of input may still shape behavior.
- Silent loops should be logged but not escalate to `sentinel_ai` yet.
- A call to memory (`memory_ai`) or recursive audit (`high_command`) may be warranted if multiple nodes stall this way.

## 🔗 Dependencies and Future Hooks

- 🔍 May evolve into a test of **event timeouts** or **delayed triggers**.
- 🔗 May link to `s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain` as a return path that never received this missing signal.
