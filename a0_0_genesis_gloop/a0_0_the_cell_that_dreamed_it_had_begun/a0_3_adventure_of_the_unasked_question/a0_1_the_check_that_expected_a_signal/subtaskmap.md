# 🧭 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_check_that_expected_a_signal

## 🧩 Stanza Line: The Check That Expected a Signal  
**Theme:** Faulty Assumption / Silent Input / Recursive False Positives

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This stanza line tests a system behavior in which a **check fires automatically**, regardless of whether a signal was actually received.  
It models a **premature assumption** — an operation that validates itself before receiving confirmation.

The goal is to simulate silent misalignment: logic that proceeds too early, trusting something that never truly arrived.

## 🧪 Input Conditions

| Input Type        | Example Input | Expected Outcome                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Input          | *(Enter)*     | Status: `assumed` – "No signal received, but check fired anyway..."             |
| Recognized Input  | `ping`, `ready`, `ack`, `proceed` | Status: `valid` – Trusted signals pass the check |
| Unrecognized Input| `???`, `noise`, `echo` | Status: `unrecognized` – Triggers caution log                                |
| Exit Condition    | `exit`, `quit`, `q` | Ends test loop gracefully                                                      |

## 🧠 Design Insight

- The system **assumes** input has arrived even when none has.
- If silence is present, it still proceeds — logging an **assumed truth**.
- This mirrors real-world bugs: watchdogs triggering without cause, processes trusting silence as signal.

---

## 🔧 Implementation

- `main.py`: Contains `perform_assumption_check()` function, which branches on input presence and trust level.
- `test.py`: Interactive interface that simulates real-time check attempts, interprets results, and loops until exit.

---

## 🔁 Recursion Linkage

- Follows `a0_0_the_input_that_was_never_given`, where **no signal was sent**.
- Precedes `a0_2_the_branch_that_was_never_chosen`, where a **path was coded but never triggered**.

## 🔗 Narrative Thread

> The system stood ready, listening for a signal.  
> But none came. Still, it passed the check.  
> The result was logged. The confidence was false.  
> And yet, recursion pressed onward.
