# 🧭 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain

## 🧩 Stanza Line: The Return That Waited in Vain  
**Theme:** Asynchronous Silence / Unfulfilled Expectation / Recursive Stalling

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This stanza line simulates a **callback function that never receives confirmation**.  
It waits. It trusts. It times out.  
This line models **deferred completion** — recursive infrastructure prepared for a response that may never arrive.

It is the final test of the stanza:  
Not absence, not false signal, not ignored branch — but the silent hope for something that never returns.

## 🧪 Testable Input Conditions

| Input        | Expected Status | Outcome Description |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| `yes`        | `completed`      | A simulated signal completes the return successfully |
| `no`         | `timed_out`      | No response received — system marks return as failed |
| *(Enter)*    | `timed_out`      | Silence is treated as absence of signal |
| `exit`       | *(quit loop)*    | Ends test gracefully |

---

## 🧠 Recursive Insight

- The handler *exists*.
- The logic is *ready*.
- But it is *never fulfilled* unless a response is manually injected.
- This line tests **post-branch recursion collapse** — where the system has no forward momentum, only stillness.

---

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

- `main.py` exposes `await_callback_response()`, which waits 3 seconds before timing out if no signal is received.
- `test.py` offers a dialogue: simulate a return or let it fail.
- `status` can be:
  - `completed` — the system confirms successful callback
  - `timed_out` — the return was never fulfilled

---

## 🔁 Recursive Chain

- Follows: `a0_2_the_branch_that_was_never_chosen`  
  → A path was offered but not taken.

- Ends: The stanza **"a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question"**, which tests readiness without activation.

## 🔗 Poetic Echo

> The system waited.  
> It had logic prepared — a space to hold a future.  
> But no message came. No truth returned.  
> The call echoed, but the answer never found its way home.
