# 📘 README – Taskmaps for a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question

This folder contains task-level metadata and stanza mappings for the fourth minigame in the first cybercell.

---

## 🧩 Minigame Title

**a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores recursive silence — where structure exists but nothing happens.  
It tests the boundaries of readiness: logic prepared to branch, check, or return… but which never receives the prompt to do so.

The player never speaks — and the system listens anyway.

---

## 📁 Included Files

| File                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `taskmap.md`        | Core definition of the minigame’s purpose, linked system, and stanza roles |
| `stanzamap_0.md`    | Poetic and structural breakdown of the first (and only) stanza |
| `milestones.md`     | Logs key recursive development checkpoints and completion status |

## 🧠 Design Overview

This minigame:
- Begins with input never received,
- Moves through faulty assumption and dormant branches,
- Ends in a return that never fires.

It is a recursive test of the system’s ability to **do nothing, properly** — and to **handle that nothing as a valid state**.

---

## 🔗 Escalation Paths

While no additional stanza is needed, this minigame may link forward into:

- `quarantine_ai/` → If recursive silence is later interpreted as a fault
- `memory_ai/` → If forgotten branches or idle returns are revisited

---

## ✅ Completion Status

All four stanza nodes implemented, tested, and documented.

This taskmap folder is now complete and can be referenced in:
- `cybercell_roadmap.md`
- `mirror_decision.md`
- Any linked escalation or memory trace
