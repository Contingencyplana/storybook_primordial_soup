# 🏁 Milestones – a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question

This file records major development and recursive design checkpoints for the fourth minigame in the first cybercell.  
The minigame explores how systems behave when structured around *absence* — of input, response, activation, and return.

## ✅ Milestone – First Stanza Complete

**Stanza:** `s0` – *The Silence That Waited for a Question*  
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and tested

| Node Folder                              | Status   | Description |
|------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `s0_0_the_input_that_was_never_given`    | ✅ Pass  | Simulates system readiness with no input |
| `s0_1_the_check_that_expected_a_signal`  | ✅ Pass  | Tests presumption logic and type-based failure |
| `s0_2_the_branch_that_was_never_chosen`  | ✅ Pass  | Models dormant, uninvoked conditional logic |
| `s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain`    | ✅ Pass  | Waits endlessly for an absent return-triggering signal |

All `main.py` and `test.py` files pass cleanly.  
All `subtaskmap.md` files written and reflect recursive roles.  
`taskmap.md` and `stanzamap_s0.md` finalized.

## 🧠 Recursive Design Notes

- This minigame tests the internal silence of the system: no inputs, no branches, no responses — yet full structure.
- The logic is passive but complete — a recursive meditation on **structure without signal**.
- No additional stanzas are required; the recursive arc is closed.
- Potential recursive escalations may branch into:
  - `quarantine_ai/` (if silence is reinterpreted as threat),
  - `memory_ai/` (if dormant paths are revisited or looped).

## 🌀 Completion Timeframe

All development completed in a recursive and contiguous cycle.  
This stanza now stands as the fourth validated minigame stanza in the first cybercell.
