# 🧩 Taskmap – a0_3_adventure_of_the_unasked_question

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores the recursive consequences of *silence*.  
It simulates a system that is structurally prepared—but never receives the input it expects.

**Primary goal:**  
Test how the system handles queries that are never asked, returns that never fire, and logic branches that remain unchosen.  
This adventure is quiet, recursive, and tragic: an ode to readiness unmet.

| 🧠 Recursive Theme | *Silent Prompts and Forgotten Callbacks*      |
| 🔧 System Touched  | Input validation, branching logic, async wait |
| 🧪 Failure Mode    | Passive recursion and dormant triggers        |
| 🧬 Fallback Logic  | Timeouts, warnings, quiet logs, sentinel ping |

## 🧩 Stanza – *The Silence That Waited for a Question*

| Node Folder                              | Role                         | Description |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `s0_0_the_input_that_was_never_given`    | Absence Root                 | The system initializes but never receives what it's waiting for. |
| `s0_1_the_check_that_expected_a_signal`  | Faulty Assumption Handler    | A check that fires regardless, assuming the signal has arrived. |
| `s0_2_the_branch_that_was_never_chosen`  | Dormant Logic Path           | A conditional branch coded for—but never triggered. |
| `s0_3_the_return_that_waited_in_vain`    | Unmet Callback               | A return handler that endlessly waits for a condition that won’t come. |

## 📎 Notes

- This minigame’s stanza is tightly recursive and should test *non-events* rather than events.
- Ideal for debugging how the system handles quiet breakdowns, misfires in expectation, and dormant code paths.
- If successful, this minigame could link to future sentinel escalation in `quarantine_ai/` or a dream-layer drift into `memory_ai/`.
