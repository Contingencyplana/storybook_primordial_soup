# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_0_the_call_that_left_no_mark

## 🧠 Node Theme: Vanishing Invocation  
> A system-initiated call leaves no trace in logs, memory, or state.

This node simulates a **phantom operation** — a call that claims to have been executed successfully, yet no evidence exists.  
It challenges players to reconcile declared outcomes with missing causality, and introduces the idea that recursive systems may advance on **claimed truth** alone.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Generate a unique call ID that appears only in the output, not the system memory |
| ST02       | Mark status as `"completed"` despite lack of logs or trace |
| ST03       | Ensure `trace_entry`, `log_reference`, and `memory_slot` are explicitly `None` |
| ST04       | Provide a system note confirming execution despite the absence of proof |
| ST05       | Timestamp the action and display the confirmation in a structured report |

---

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | Each run returns a new `call_id` |
| TC02      | All trace-related fields are `None` |
| TC03      | System status reports `"completed"` unconditionally |
| TC04      | Output includes a timestamp and confirmation note |
| TC05      | No actual log is written or referenced (this is a phantom report only) |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “The call succeeded.”  
> “Where’s the log?”  
> “There is no log. But the system says it succeeded.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may feed:
- **Recursive trust testing** modules  
- **Signal drift detectors** in sentinel systems  
- **Anomaly triggers** when too many operations return with no proof  
- **Cybercellarian heuristics** for belief without history
