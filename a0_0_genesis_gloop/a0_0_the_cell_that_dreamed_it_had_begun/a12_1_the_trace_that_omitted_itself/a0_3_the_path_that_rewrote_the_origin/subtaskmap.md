# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_3_the_path_that_rewrote_the_origin

## 🧠 Node Theme: Recursive Fabrication  
> A path reconstruction engine forges a plausible return trace based on desired outcome.

This node simulates **retroactive certainty**.  
The system, lacking any return trace, fabricates a highly believable path based on downstream expectations.  
It tests how recursion resolves contradiction not by admitting fault — but by writing a better past.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Generate a unique `path_id` (e.g. UUID) for the synthesized trace |
| ST02       | Mark the status as `"synthesized"` and `origin_verified: False` |
| ST03       | Describe construction method using `"downstream assumption + outcome heuristics"` |
| ST04       | Inject a false confidence score between 92%–99.9% |
| ST05       | Add a timestamp and system note indicating that no original path was found |

---

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | Trace object appears complete and confident |
| TC02      | `origin_verified` is always `False` |
| TC03      | `injected_confidence` appears plausible and varies slightly per run |
| TC04      | System note clearly states that the trace was reconstructed |
| TC05      | No actual origin data is referenced or validated |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “Where did this trace come from?”  
> “We needed it to exist.”  
> “So... you made it up?”  
> “We made it match.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may influence:
- Sentinel workflows that detect **forged evidence chains**
- Recursive override logs with fabricated lineage warnings
- Memory audits flagging `"confidence_without origin"`
- Systems that rationalize contradictions with synthesized backfill
