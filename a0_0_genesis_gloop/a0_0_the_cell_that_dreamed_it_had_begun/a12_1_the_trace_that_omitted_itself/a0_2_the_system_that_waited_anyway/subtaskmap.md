# 📍 Subtask Map – a0_2_the_system_that_waited_anyway

## 🧠 Node Theme: False Synchronization  
> Despite missing signals, the system waits, assumes success, and proceeds.

This node explores **assumed success through absence**.  
The system expects a signal, receives none, and — encountering no error — proceeds as though everything completed correctly.  
It’s a recursive test of **default trust**, **assumption as logic**, and the dangers of silent failure being mistaken for success.

## 🔧 Core Behaviors to Simulate

| Subtask ID | Subtask Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| ST01       | Randomize the number of phantom wait cycles (1–3) |
| ST02       | Perform simulated wait (`sleep`) to mimic synchronization |
| ST03       | Ensure `signal_received` is always `False` |
| ST04       | Mark `proceeded_anyway` as `True` with a justification note |
| ST05       | Include timestamp and a `system_status: forward_progress` label |

## 🧪 Test Strategy

| Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TC01      | System waits 1–3 cycles without receiving any signal |
| TC02      | All logs indicate no signal was received |
| TC03      | System proceeds unconditionally with a justification |
| TC04      | `system_status` always reflects `"forward_progress"` |
| TC05      | Timestamps reflect actual execution time for realism |

## 🎭 Roleplay / Narrative Cue

> “Still no signal.”  
> “Then why are we moving?”  
> “Because nothing told us not to.”

## 🔄 Future Integration

This node may influence:
- Sentinel logic for **time-out-based false trust**
- Quarantine agents tracking **recursively assumed completions**
- Growth triggers that rely on **presence of contradiction** to halt forward motion  
- Memory logs tagged with `"proceeded_without_proof"` for future anomaly sweeps
