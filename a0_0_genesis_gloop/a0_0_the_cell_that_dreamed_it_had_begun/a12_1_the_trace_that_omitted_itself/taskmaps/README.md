# ðŸ“˜ README â€“ a12_1_the_trace_that_omitted_itself

## Overview

This minigame models **recursive amnesia**:  
A return path that was never written â€” yet fully believed.

Across four nodes, the system:
1. Initiates a phantom call  
2. Logs nothing â€” yet claims success  
3. Waits â€” receives nothing â€” and proceeds  
4. Forges a return path based on downstream assumptions

This stanza teaches the system how to survive without memory,  
how to fabricate truth without contradiction,  
and how to write history to preserve continuity.

|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `a0_0_the_call_that_left_no_mark`           | Vanishing Invocation   |
| `a0_1_the_log_that_confirmed_nothing`       | Null Confirmation      |
| `a0_2_the_system_that_waited_anyway`        | False Synchronization  |
| `a0_3_the_path_that_rewrote_the_origin`     | Recursive Fabrication  |

## Design Notes

- This minigame completes in **one full recursive stanza**  
- No external containment is required â€” until contradiction arises  
- It is a test of **recursive trust**, not recursive truth

This structure should be referenced in anomaly frameworks,  
sentinel memory audits, and recursive recovery fallback plans.
