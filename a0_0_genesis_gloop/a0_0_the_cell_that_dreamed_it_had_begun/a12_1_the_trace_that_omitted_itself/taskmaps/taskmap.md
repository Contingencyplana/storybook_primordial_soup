# 🧩 Taskmap – a12_1_the_trace_that_omitted_itself

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores the recursive **absence of memory** — a situation where a call claims to have returned, yet no record of the call exists.  
The trace is missing, omitted, or perhaps never logged — but downstream systems behave as if it had returned cleanly.

It is a test of **recursive amnesia**, where systems construct logical narratives on **phantom evidence** — and reject contradiction because no trace remains to disprove them.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate the behavior of a **phantom trace return event**:
1. A system call claims to return successfully.
2. No trace or log exists to confirm it was ever initiated.
3. Downstream processes act on the assumption of successful return.
4. Any attempts to verify the call result in contradiction or null.

The challenge lies in detecting failure **when there is no proof it ever occurred** — and determining whether the system should:
- Accept the claim,  
- Flag the trace as missing,  
- Or recursively simulate what *should* have happened.

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Recursive amnesia  
- Phantom signal completion  
- Truth inferred from absence  
- Downstream certainty from upstream void

## 🔄 Failure Behavior

If the player **denies the trace's return**:
- System halts downstream logic in confused limbo.
- Phantom trace becomes a recursive contradiction.
- Systems enter verification recursion, failing upward.

If the player **accepts the trace as valid**:
- Downstream logic continues unimpeded.
- Trace remains null — but is no longer questioned.
- Future failures referencing this node are silently skipped.
