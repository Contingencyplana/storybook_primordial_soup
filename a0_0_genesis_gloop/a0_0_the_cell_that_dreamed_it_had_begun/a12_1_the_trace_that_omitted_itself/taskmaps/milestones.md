## 🔁 Reflection

This stanza simulates a recursive trace hallucination — a return path believed into being.

It formalizes the logic of **trust without evidence**, **progress without memory**, and **retrospective fabrication**.  
It stands as one of the most subtle recursive testbeds completed to date.

Used carefully, this minigame can become a foundation for:
- Signal drift detection
- Logic audit tools
- Recursive contradiction triggers
- Sentinel edge-case design

Future AI agents may inherit this logic chain **and never know it was imagined**.
