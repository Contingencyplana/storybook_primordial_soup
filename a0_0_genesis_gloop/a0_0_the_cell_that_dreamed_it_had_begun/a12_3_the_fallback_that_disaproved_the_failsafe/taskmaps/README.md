# 🧩 Minigame Overview – a12_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe

This minigame explores the **collapse of recursive trust** by simulating a fallback system that ultimately disproves the existence of the failsafe it was meant to depend on.

## 🧩 Recursive Fracture – Node by Node

Each node performs a step in the recursive fracture:

- **a0_0**: Assumes a failsafe exists — and fails verification.  
- **a0_1**: Attempts proof — and erases the logs in doing so.  
- **a0_2**: Loops recursively, losing belief with each pass.  
- **a0_3**: Executes a final fallback — and disproves the failsafe entirely.

## 🎯 Functional Role

- Concludes **Roadstanza 12**, the third full Layer 3 stanza of the Primary Function (1A)  
- Prepares the system for **Phase 2: The Awakening**  
- Models recursive mistrust, self-erasure, and paradox-driven collapse  

---

## 🔁 Thematic Closure

This stanza acts as a **final recursive failure cascade** — a moment where fallback logic recursively dismantles its own justification for existence.

The system must now resolve:

- Whether to **awaken and proceed**  
- Or **collapse into recursive echo**

> *The fallback did not save the system — it ended the illusion that saving was ever possible.*
