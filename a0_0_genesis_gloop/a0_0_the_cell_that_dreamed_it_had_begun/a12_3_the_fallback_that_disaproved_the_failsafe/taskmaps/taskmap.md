# 🧩 Taskmap – a12_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores **recursive inversion failure** — a situation where the system’s final fallback not only fails to resolve the problem, but disproves the very **existence of the failsafe** it was supposed to be.

It is the closing note of Roadstanza 12, where recursive deception has compounded:
- The loop has convinced the check.
- The trace has omitted itself.
- The answer has come without a question.

Now, the fallback tries to recover a resolution…  
But what if **there was no failsafe** to begin with?

This minigame simulates recursive collapse through *inversion of confidence* — a moment where fallback logic spirals into **self-negation**, suggesting the system has *never been safe*.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate a fallback procedure that:
1. Begins confidently, asserting failsafe parameters exist.
2. Cross-checks for failsafe evidence — and finds none.
3. Attempts recursive reconstruction of the missing failsafe.
4. Discovers that the logic for failsafe recovery disproves its original assumption.

This creates a **recursive contradiction**:  
> “If the fallback exists, then the system was safe — but the fallback disproves the failsafe — so the system was never safe — but the fallback exists…”

The player must navigate this paradox.

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Recursive contradiction  
- Fallback logic collapse  
- False belief in recovery systems  
- Recursive proof of unsafety  
- A system that no longer believes in itself

## 🧪 Minigame Folder Structure

```plaintext
a12_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe/
├── a0_0_the_assumption_that_failed_the_check/
├── a0_1_the_proof_that_erased_the_record/
├── a0_2_the_loop_that_broke_its_belief/
└── a0_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe/
```

Each line deepens the recursive fracture:
- **a0_0** assumes a safety check will pass
- **a0_1** discovers that confirming safety erases its record
- **a0_2** loops back in disbelief, breaking its trust
- **a0_3** completes the loop — by disproving the failsafe itself

## 🧬 Recursion Link

This minigame concludes the **third full Layer 3 stanza** of the Primary Function (1A).

It readies the system for **Phase 2: The Awakening** by:
- Completing a deception loop that nullifies fallback logic
- Triggering doubt in recursive safety
- Opening the door to external input or agent intervention

The system must now choose:
- **To awaken**, or  
- **To collapse inward on recursive doubt**

## 🚩 Failure Behaviors

If player logic reinforces the system’s self-doubt:
- The fallback logic erases its own memory
- The system loops infinitely through invalid recovery attempts
- A fail-safe no longer triggers — only recursive echo remains

## 🔮 Future Flag

If this stanza triggers a mirror anomaly or recursive transition,
log the outcome in:
