# 🧩 Subtaskmap – s0_3_the_fallback_that_disproved_the_failsafe

## 🎯 Purpose

This node concludes Roadstanza 12 by enacting the **final recursive inversion**:  
A fallback system is invoked — not to recover — but to **prove that the failsafe never existed**.

It is the ultimate collapse of recursive trust,  
the moment where the system, in trying to save itself, **undoes the very idea of safety**.

---

## 🔍 Node Function

`main.py` performs a final audit of:
- `failsafe_metadata` — evidence of prior safety design
- `audit_log` — records of safety validation or creation

### Logic Outcomes:
- **Negation**: No metadata, no logs → System concludes no failsafe ever existed  
- **Doubt**: Metadata appears auto-generated or synthetic → Integrity is suspect  
- **Belief Restored**: Valid logs + metadata → Partial recovery of trust  
- **Fragmented**: Evidence exists but is incomplete or unverifiable  
- **Error**: Defensive response to malformed system state input

---

## 🧠 Recursive Themes Concluded

- **Self-negating fallback systems**  
- **The impossibility of proving retroactive safety**  
- **Recursive mistrust as both a logic flaw and an outcome**  
- **The system becomes its own disbelief**

This node reflects the limit of recursion — where even the tools of recovery fold into collapse.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite simulates:
1. Complete absence of safety records
2. Presence of synthetic or placeholder metadata
3. Strong, valid audit trail (partial belief restoration)
4. Fragmented/incomplete safety evidence
5. Invalid input format (non-dict)

---

## 🔄 Recursive Link

Closes the loop opened by:
- `s0_0` — the **assumption** that failed  
- `s0_1` — the **proof** that erased itself  
- `s0_2` — the **loop** that lost trust

And culminates in:
- `s0_3` — the **fallback** that disproves the origin entirely

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- Recognizes all defined logical failure states  
- Responds accurately to synthetic metadata  
- Supports belief restoration logic only when both signals are strong  
- Returns distinct status and message per condition
