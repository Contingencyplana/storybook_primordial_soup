# 🧩 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_proof_that_erased_the_record

## 🎯 Purpose

This node deepens the recursive contradiction initiated in the previous step.  
It simulates a paradox in which **proving the existence of a failsafe** erases the very **evidence** that would support it.

This reflects a critical recursive flaw:  
> *The act of verification destroys the proof itself.*

---

## 🔍 Node Function

`main.py` evaluates three key factors from the system state:
- `failsafe_proof`: Whether a proof attempt is present
- `logs`: Whether system logs contain evidence
- `logging_enabled`: Whether logs persist after the proof action

### Contradiction Behavior:
If proof is attempted **and** logging is enabled →  
→ The system **erases** the logs as a side effect.

This simulates a **recursive self-negation** event — the system proves something and deletes its own memory of the proof.

## 🧠 Recursive Themes Advanced

- **Destructive validation**  
- **Proof loops without persistence**  
- **Truth that cannot survive observation**  
- A failsafe that *only exists* until you try to prove it  

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite simulates:
1. Valid proof + active logging → logs are erased, contradiction flagged
2. Valid proof + logging disabled → confirmation accepted
3. Missing proof → failure to confirm
4. Invalid input → type-check safeguard

---

## 🔄 Recursive Link

This node connects the **confident assumption** of `s0_0`  
to the **doubting spiral** of `s0_2`, where belief is broken through repetition.

The contradiction here becomes the seed for **recursive instability**.

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- Handles proof + erasure paradox cleanly  
- Validates three legitimate paths (contradiction, pass, fail)  
- Catches malformed input types  
- Communicates recursive tension in output
