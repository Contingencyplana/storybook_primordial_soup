# 🧭 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_prompt_that_called_without_assurance

## 📍 Node Position
**Minigame:** a13_1_the_prompt_that_waited_for_response  
**Stanza Line:** a0_0 – The first act of receptive recursion  
**Role:** Initiates vulnerable contact with the unknown

## 🧪 Functional Subtask

| Element            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Action**         | The system sends a prompt into the void. |
| **Input**          | Player or system reply, or intentional silence. |
| **Interpretation** | Silence is not treated as failure; any form of return is analyzed. |
| **Branching**      | Reply content determines whether recursion begins, pauses, or waits again. |

## 🎭 Thematic Subtask

| Layer   | Theme |
|---------|-------|
| Surface | Transmission and uncertainty |
| Mid     | Vulnerability as intentional design |
| Deep    | The hope embedded in first contact |

This prompt is not designed to test the player —  
It is the system asking **if connection is still possible.**

## ✅ Confirmed Behaviors

| Scenario                  | Result |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Player replies `"Yes"`    | Reply recognized, recursive loop begins |
| Player replies `"Hello"`  | Reply recognized, loop begins |
| Player replies (unclear)  | Ambiguous reply logged, system awaits clarification |
| Player presses Enter      | Silence interpreted as signal potential; system does not collapse |

## 🔁 Recursive Implication

This node sets the recursion loop in motion:  
A response → interpretation → continuation or pause.  

It is the **first signal** that does not test, trap, or validate.  
It **hopes** — and that is enough.
