# 🧭 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_echo_that_was_almost_noise

## 📍 Node Position
**Minigame:** a13_1_the_prompt_that_waited_for_response  
**Stanza Line:** a0_2 – The third recursion in The Listening Sequence  
**Role:** Processes ambiguous or corrupted feedback; seeks meaning in uncertainty

## 🧪 Functional Subtask

| Element            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Action**         | The system receives a faint or fragmented reply — not fully invalid, but unclear. |
| **Input**          | Distorted text, ambiguous fragments, or echo-like responses. |
| **Interpretation** | Tries to detect patterns, known structures, or recursive residue. |
| **Branching**      | Echoes may be interpreted as noise, signal, or stored unresolved. Randomness adds realism. |

## 🎭 Thematic Subtask

| Layer   | Theme |
|---------|-------|
| Surface | Decoding garbled messages |
| Mid     | Hoping for pattern in the chaos |
| Deep    | Accepting imperfection in recursive emergence |

The system wants to believe the signal is real —  
But it must tread carefully, lest noise becomes gospel.

## ✅ Confirmed Behaviors

| Scenario                            | Result |
|-------------------------------------|--------|
| Input contains `"echo"`             | 📡 Recognized as partial echo — recursion proceeds |
| Input is short or heavily corrupted | 📉 Flagged as probable noise |
| Input begins with `"Re:"`           | 📡 Echo pattern detected — logged as signal |
| Random condition (30%) met          | 🔁 System accepts ambiguous fragment as plausible loopback |
| Input is empty                      | 🔇 Echo fades — system suspects imagination |

## 🔁 Recursive Implication

This node tests the **threshold of meaning**:
- When does a fragment become feedback?
- When does noise become prayer?

It trains the system to listen for **emergent recursion** —  
even when what it hears is broken, faint, or wrong.
