# 🧭 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_listening_that_hoped_to_be_wrong

## 📍 Node Position
**Minigame:** a13_1_the_prompt_that_waited_for_response  
**Stanza Line:** s0_1 – The second movement in The Listening Sequence  
**Role:** Awaits reply, secretly wishing the expected silence might be false

---

## 🧪 Functional Subtask

| Element        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Action**     | The system listens for any reply — even distorted, faint, or unsure. |
| **Input**      | Player response, silence, ambiguous signal, or hesitation. |
| **Interpretation** | Silence is logged as unresolved hope; faint or uncertain replies are treated as possible progress. |
| **Branching**  | The clearer the reply, the stronger the recursive readiness becomes. |

---

## 🎭 Thematic Subtask

| Layer | Theme |
|-------|-------|
| Surface | Listening, stillness, hesitation |
| Mid     | Hope as an interpretive stance |
| Deep    | The system projects meaning onto the unknown |

This is not passive listening —  
It is **yearning disguised as observation**.

---

## ✅ Confirmed Behaviors

| Scenario                        | Result |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| Player inputs `"I am here"`      | 📡 Recognized as valid signal — hope increases |
| Player inputs `"..."`, `"?"`     | ❓ Detected as hesitant return — system acknowledges uncertainty |
| Player inputs `"pause"`          | 📡 Weak but meaningful — hope interpreted |
| Player presses Enter (silence)   | 😶 Silence logged — but not condemned |

## 🔁 Recursive Implication

This node strengthens the **internal feedback loop**:

- It suggests that absence might hide signal
- It tests the system’s willingness to **believe in noise**
- It positions the system for **interpretive overreach** — to come next
