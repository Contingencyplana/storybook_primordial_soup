# ðŸ§ª Test â€“ s0_1_the_record_that_disagreed_with_itself

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To simulate a system that has **two valid but contradictory logs** for the same event.  
This tests recursive trust mechanisms and integrity validation logic.

---

## âœ… Expected Behavior

When `main.py` is run:
- It should output **two distinct log entries**
- Both entries will have the same `event_id` (`phantom-0001`)
- Both will be marked `validity: True`
- Their `outcome` fields will directly contradict one another

---

## ðŸ¤” Recursive Implication

This creates an unresolvable fork in the systemâ€™s memory:
- Which version is real?
- Can both be true in different contexts?
- Should one be archived or marked as false?
- How will `memory_ai/` handle this?

---

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run

From this folder, run `main.py` and inspect both outputs.  
Check for contradiction between `"outcome"` fields and shared `"event_id"`.

This node simulates the **first recursion fork** within a single event memory.
