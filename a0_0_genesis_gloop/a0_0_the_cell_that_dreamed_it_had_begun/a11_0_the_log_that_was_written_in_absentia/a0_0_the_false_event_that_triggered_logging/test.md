# ðŸ§ª Test â€“ s0_0_the_false_event_that_triggered_logging

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To verify that the system correctly generates and prints a log entry triggered by a **false or phantom event** â€” a memory of something that never happened.

This test simulates:
- A fabricated input trigger
- System behavior under logging initiated by invalid memory reference
- An escalation flag set without proper cause

---

## âœ… Expected Behavior

When `main.py` is executed:
- A log entry should be printed to the terminal
- The log should include the following:
  - `event_id`: A clearly invalid or placeholder ID (e.g., `phantom-0001`)
  - `trigger`: Describes an unverifiable or null signal
  - `validity`: Set to `False`
  - `escalation_flag`: Set to `True`
  - `details`: Mention of missing or unverifiable source

---

## ðŸ§¼ Failure Modes

- If no output is shown: `log_false_event()` may not be called
- If `validity` is not `False`, or `escalation_flag` is missing: logic error in `main.py`
- If details lack poetic anomaly narrative: please revise message

---

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run

Run `main.py` from this directory and inspect console output. Verify that the system correctly reflects a falsified trigger event.
