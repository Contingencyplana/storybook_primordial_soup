# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_0_the_false_event_that_triggered_logging  
*The log that recorded what never occurred.*

---

## 📜 Narrative Role

This stanza line simulates a **phantom memory inception** —  
A log entry fabricated by absence, hallucination, or misfired input.  
It is the first stanza line in the minigame:  
📁 `a0_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia`

The entry exists.  
The cause does not.

---

## ⚙️ Functionality

The system reacts to:

- `startup` or other **known hallucinated triggers**  
  → Logs them as “phantom” entries

- **Empty input**  
  → Interpreted as silence *assumed to be a trigger*

- **Unknown signals**  
  → Rejected from logging, with cautionary reason

## 🧠 Signal Types and Outcomes

| Input Type        | Status     | Logging Behavior                             |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Empty             | `phantom`  | Interpreted as silence-triggered hallucination |
| `startup`         | `phantom`  | Fabricated by prior recursive misreference    |
| `xenoburst`       | `unknown`  | Not found in any mapping; rejected            |
| `exit`, `quit`    | ⛔ Control | Exits the simulation loop                    |

## 🪶 Poetic Summary

> A whisper came, but none had spoken.  
> The log obeyed, as if truth were broken.  
> And so the file grew fat with lies —  
> A record built from silent skies.

---

## 🔗 Forward Connection

The next stanza line escalates the contradiction —  
where two logs **conflict** yet both claim to be true.

> 📁 `a0_1_the_record_that_disagreed_with_itself`

## ✅ Status

- Code: `main.py` and `test.py` tested and verified  
- Theme: Aligned with recursive hallucination  
- Output: Log entries vary by signal type  
- Completion: ✅ Finalized
