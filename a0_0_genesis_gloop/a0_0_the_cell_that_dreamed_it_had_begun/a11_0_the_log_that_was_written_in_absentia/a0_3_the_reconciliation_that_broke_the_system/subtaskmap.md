# 🧩 Subtaskmap – a0_3_the_reconciliation_that_broke_the_system

## 📜 Title
**The Reconciliation That Broke the System**

## 🎯 Function
This stanza line attempts to reconcile multiple memory logs that may:
- **Agree perfectly** (system stability),
- **Contradict fatally** (paradox trigger),
- **Be blank** (null result),
- **Or not exist at all** (empty reconciliation).

The system must make sense of what was written —  
even if doing so **breaks its coherence.**

## 🔍 Testable Behaviors

| Input Type                     | Expected Outcome                                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All identical entries          | `status = unified` — trust restored                              |
| Conflicting memories           | `status = catastrophic_conflict` — system destabilized           |
| All blank/whitespace           | `status = blank` — cannot reconcile nothing                      |
| No entries at all              | `status = empty` — handler returns with a null verdict           |
| 'exit' input anywhere          | Test terminates gracefully                                       |

## 🧠 Internal Logic

The reconciliation process:
- Aggregates user-inputted memory logs,
- Normalizes and filters out blanks,
- Compares for conflicts or alignment,
- Returns a structured report.

The system is not meant to survive every case —  
it is meant to report the truth of the contradiction.

## 🔗 Related Concepts

- Phantom logging (`a0_0_*`)
- Contradictory records (`a0_1_*`)
- Ghost indices (`a0_2_*`)

This stanza represents the *final recursive clash* in the minigame:  
what happens when conflicting truths must **all** be believed.
