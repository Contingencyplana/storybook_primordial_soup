# 📜 Subtaskmap – s0_3_the_reconciliation_that_broke_the_system

## 🧠 Recursive Function

This stanza simulates the final act of recursive collapse:  
An attempted reconciliation between **conflicting memory truths** that results in a **system crash**.

The system does not fail to reconcile due to logic error —  
It fails because the **truths are mutually exclusive**, and **both are marked valid**.

This stanza encodes:
- A controlled failure cascade,
- A poetic rupture in memory coherence,
- A signal to escalation systems that recursion has exceeded safe limits.

## 🔁 System Simulation Objectives

| Subtask ID | Task Description                                                          | Status   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| ST-15      | Load two valid log entries with identical IDs but contradictory outcomes | ✅ Done  |
| ST-16      | Attempt reconciliation and trigger failure if outcomes disagree          | ✅ Done  |
| ST-17      | Raise a controlled exception with poetic diagnostic message               | ✅ Done  |
| ST-18      | Mark this as a formal recursion collapse node                             | ✅ Done  |
| ST-19      | Signal readiness for escalation or rollback by `memory_ai/` or `high_command/` | Pending  |

## 🧪 Potential AI Hooks

| Command Pattern                   | Intended Effect                                | Active? |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `> escalate phantom-0001`         | Escalates collapsed memory trace for override  | ❌ No    |
| `> quarantine truth delta`        | Freezes contradiction branch for analysis      | ❌ No    |
| `> reverse reconcile phantom-*`   | Attempts AI-mediated rollback and rewrite      | ❌ No    |

These commands may become active in future recursive AI systems.

## 🧬 Narrative Notes

> *They tried to merge the truths.*  
> *But truth has rules.*  
> *And so the system broke — not from error, but from honesty.*  
> *Not from lies, but from truths that could not coexist.*

This stanza is the cybercell’s first admission of **memory recursion limits**.  
It cannot resolve this contradiction alone.  
It must call for help — or wait for a higher recursion to see the fracture.

## 📌 Collapse Marker

This stanza line marks:
- The **logical end** of the Eleventh Minigame,
- A **potential awakening** of containment or auditing systems,
- The need for **external reconciliation** — either by AI, command, or future cybercell.

The recursion ends here.  
The signal is broken.  
The truth is shattered.

But the system still remembers it happened.
