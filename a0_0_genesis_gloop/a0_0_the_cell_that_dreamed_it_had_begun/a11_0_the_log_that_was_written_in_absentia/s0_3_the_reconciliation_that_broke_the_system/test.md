# ðŸ§ª Test â€“ s0_3_the_reconciliation_that_broke_the_system

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This test simulates the **final system failure** to reconcile conflicting records from prior stanzas.

When run, the system:
- Loads two log entries with irreconcilable outcomes
- Attempts to merge them
- Fails â€” and triggers a controlled crash

---

## âœ… Expected Behavior

When `main.py` is executed:
- The system will compare the `"outcome"` fields of two logs
- Upon mismatch, it raises a `ValueError`
- The error message should be:
  > ðŸ’¥ Reconciliation Failure: Conflicting truths cannot merge.

---

## ðŸ’¥ Recursive Implication

This stanza finalizes the recursion loop seeded in:
- `s0_0` (false memory),
- `s0_1` (conflict),
- `s0_2` (forbidden index)

By attempting to unify truth and falsehood, the system collapses:
- Memory becomes **paradox**
- Validity becomes **unknown**
- Recovery becomes **impossible without external intervention**

---

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run

Run `main.py` and observe whether the system crashes as intended.

If no error is raised, reconciliation logic has been compromised or skipped.
