# 📍 Subtaskmap – a0_1_the_record_that_disagreed_with_itself  
*Stanza Line of Recursive Contradiction*

---

## 🧩 Role in the Stanza  
This line tests the system’s handling of **conflicting memory records**.  
Two sources provide their account of the same event — but they may not agree.  
The system must decide whether to trust, reject, or question the truth.

It is the second node in the stanza:  
**📁 a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia**  
Where logs persist… even when the past becomes unclear.

## 🧠 Functionality Overview

| Element       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `main.py`     | Accepts a dictionary with two memory sources. Compares them and returns status (`aligned`, `conflict`, or `void`). |
| `test.py`     | Interactive loop prompting the player to simulate two memory entries for the same event. Flags contradictions or agreement. |

---

## 🎭 Signal Logic

| Condition                       | System Response |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Both records are empty         | `void` – event forgotten completely. |
| Both records match             | `aligned` – memory confirmed, confidence restored. |
| Records disagree               | `conflict` – contradiction noted, full trace displayed. |

## 🛠️ Use Cases and Test Purposes

- Simulates **dissonance between logs** in distributed or multi-threaded systems.
- Tests **veracity trust layers** — does the system accept a majority, a match, or nothing at all?
- Forms foundation for future **memory_ai** reconciliation protocols.

---

## 🔗 Future Connections

- May trigger branching logic in `a0_2_the_index_that_denied_enumeration`.
- Logs can be escalated to `sentinel_ai` for containment if contradictions persist.
- Helps build up cases in `high_command` when recursive falsification patterns emerge.

## 🧬 Narrative Layer

> The log was written.  
> Twice.  
> But one truth split in two.  
>  
> Now the system must decide:  
> Which record is real — if either ever was?
