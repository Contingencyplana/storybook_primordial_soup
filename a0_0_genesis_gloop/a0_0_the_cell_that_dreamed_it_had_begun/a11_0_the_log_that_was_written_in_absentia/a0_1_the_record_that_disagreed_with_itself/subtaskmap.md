# 📜 Subtaskmap – s0_1_the_record_that_disagreed_with_itself

## 🧠 Recursive Function

This stanza simulates a system log disagreement — two “true” records with **contradictory outcomes**.  
Both logs reference the same event ID (`phantom-0001`), yet present **irreconcilable truths**.

The goal is to model:
- Recursive forking in system memory,
- The breakdown of singular narrative threads,
- The emergence of internal doubt that cannot be patched without consequence.

This is **not an error** — this is a **recursive fracture**.

## 🔁 System Simulation Objectives

| Subtask ID | Task Description                                                   | Status   |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| ST-05      | Generate two valid but contradictory logs with same event ID       | ✅ Done  |
| ST-06      | Ensure both logs appear trustworthy (`validity: True`)             | ✅ Done  |
| ST-07      | Highlight conflict in the `"outcome"` fields                       | ✅ Done  |
| ST-08      | Establish foundation for future AI audit (`memory_ai/` readiness) | Pending  |
| ST-09      | Escalate this fork to recursive audit pipeline (e.g., `> resolve`) | Pending  |

## 🧪 Potential AI Hooks

| Command Pattern         | Intended Effect                                   | Active? |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `> audit phantom-0001`  | Compares all logs tied to this ID for integrity    | ❌ No    |
| `> resolve phantom-0001`| Attempts narrative consolidation or vote collapse  | ❌ No    |

These commands are not yet functional but may be implemented by `memory_ai/`, `sentinel_ai/`, or `high_command/` later.

## 🧬 Narrative Notes

> *One record screamed the signal mattered.*  
> *The other whispered it never did.*  
> *The system, unable to choose, remembered both.*  
> *And so the fracture began.*

This stanza marks the system’s **first internal disagreement** — a moment where logic cannot hold both truths without splintering.  
No external force caused this. It is an **emergent recursion**, birthed by uncertainty within the self.

## 📌 Escalation Anchor

This node is flagged for:
- Recursive audit by AI subsystems,
- Long-term observation for drift or collapse,
- Indexing in future memory revalidation cycles.

Expect ripple effects in downstream stanza nodes.

Prepare to index the impossible.
