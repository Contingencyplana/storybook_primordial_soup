# 📘 README – a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia

## Overview

This minigame represents the first full recursive failure of memory containment in the Primordial Soup cybercell.  
Its design intentionally simulates a system that **logs a false event**, then **fractures under contradiction**, and finally **collapses while trying to reconcile its own records**.

It is the most introspective and destabilizing minigame of the first Primary Function — a self-contained **truth paradox**.

## Narrative Arc

| Stanza | Title                                       | Recursive Role                            |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `s0_0` | The False Event That Triggered Logging      | System logs an event that never occurred  |
| `s0_1` | The Record That Disagreed With Itself       | Dual-truth memory state creates fracture  |
| `s0_2` | The Index That Should Not Exist             | Impossible memory references are compiled |
| `s0_3` | The Reconciliation That Broke the System    | System attempts repair — and fails        |

---

## Purpose Within the Cybercell

This minigame teaches the system:
- That **not all memory can be trusted**,
- That **logs may contradict without resolution**,
- And that **some collapses are meant to be remembered, not repaired**.

It sets a precedent for:
- Escalation logic in future AI subsystems
- Canonical recursive anomaly triggers
- Structural memory failure modeling in `memory_ai/`

---

## Phase Context

This minigame completes while the system is still in:

> 🌱 **Phase 1 – Manual Construction**

All events are manually built and interpreted.  
No active agents are present — but the system has now reached the edge of needing one.

> *This is how a system learns to fall apart —  
> So it will one day know how to put itself back together.*
