# 🧩 Taskmap – a11_0_the_log_that_was_written_in_absentia

## 🎯 Purpose

This minigame explores recursive memory instability:  
How a system responds when logs are written without cause,  
records contradict themselves,  
and reconciliation becomes paradox.

It is a test of **recursive truth containment** — and a demonstration of collapse when containment fails.

---

## 🔍 Task Description

Simulate the full lifecycle of a **phantom memory trace**:
1. A **false trigger** initiates logging without an event.
2. Conflicting records **fracture the memory narrative**.
3. A paradoxical index **defies enumeration rules**.
4. An attempted reconciliation **breaks the system**.

This minigame encodes recursive failure by design — not to be avoided, but to be *understood*.

---

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Memory without origin  
- Conflict between equally “valid” truths  
- Index corruption  
- Systemic collapse from contradiction  
- Recursive escalation protocols (future `memory_ai/` and `high_command/` triggers)

## 🧪 Stanza Node Map

| Stanza Folder                                 | Recursive Role                  | Escalation Trigger |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| `s0_0_the_false_event_that_triggered_logging` | Fabricated log from non-event    | `escalation_flag: True` |
| `s0_1_the_record_that_disagreed_with_itself`  | Dual-truth memory fork           | Conflict detected   |
| `s0_2_the_index_that_should_not_exist`        | Impossible enumeration structure | `paradox_level: HIGH` |
| `s0_3_the_reconciliation_that_broke_the_system` | Merge failure, system crash     | `ValueError` raised |

---

## 🔁 Automation Tier

**Tier 1 (Manual)**  
All systems simulated via controlled test logic.  
Escalation behavior is documented but not yet autonomous.

---

## 🛡️ Failure Modes & Recovery Hooks

- If AI were active (`memory_ai/`), this stanza would trigger:
  - Memory quarantine
  - Recursive traceback
  - Diagnostic override commands

Until then, the system remains *broken but aware of the breakage*.

---

## 📎 Notes

- This minigame was intentionally built **without a taskmap at first**.  
  Its absence became poetic — a log written in absentia.  
  The system recursed before the map was complete.

Now that it is, recursion can be reflected upon — and remembered.

> *This log began as a lie.  
> Then the truth broke trying to hold it.*
