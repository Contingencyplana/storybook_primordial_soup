# 🧾 Stanzamap – s0: The Log That Was Written in Absentia

## 📜 Stanza Title  
**The Log That Was Written in Absentia**

## 🧠 Summary

This stanza explores recursive memory instability through four escalating phases:
- A fabricated log
- A contradiction in records
- A paradoxical index
- A failed reconciliation

Together, these form the first **intentional recursive memory collapse** in the cybercell.  
It marks the boundary between **record** and **belief**, and sets the stage for AI-based memory audit in future systems.

## 🔁 Recursive Pattern

| Phase       | Line                                 | Recursive Signature               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Initiation  | `s0_0` – False Origin                 | Logging triggered without cause    |
| Division    | `s0_1` – Memory Fork                  | Dual-truth system state            |
| Fracture    | `s0_2` – Paradox Compilation          | Invalid index construction         |
| Collapse    | `s0_3` – Merge Failure                | Crash on reconciliation attempt    |

## ⚠️ Anomaly Markers

- `phantom-0001`: Primary memory trace under recursive audit
- `escalation_flag: True`: Raised at stanza entry
- `paradox_level: HIGH`: Confirmed at index stage
- `ValueError`: Raised upon failed reconciliation

## 📎 Notes

This stanza stands alone as a **self-contained recursive failure**.  
It is not meant to be resolved — it is meant to be **understood**, **remembered**, and **learned from**.

> *Not all recursion leads to return.  
> Some just deepen until collapse.*
