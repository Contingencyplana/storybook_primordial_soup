# ðŸ§ª Test â€“ s0_2_the_index_that_should_not_exist

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To simulate the generation of an index that violates internal constraints:
- Negative positions
- Infinite references
- Unknown or paradoxical sources

This node represents **recursive corruption of reference structures**.

---

## âœ… Expected Behavior

When `main.py` is executed:
- A dictionary-style index should be printed to the console
- It should contain four entries, each with unusual or impossible properties:
  - Position `-3` (illegal)
  - Position `"âˆž"` (non-integer)
  - Source `"Unknown"` or `"Reversed Index"`
- The field `validation` should explicitly say `FAILED`
- The `paradox_level` should be marked `"HIGH"`

---

## ðŸ¤” Recursive Implication

This stanza line represents a breach in:
- Reference integrity
- Causal traceability
- Memory enumeration reliability

> The index exists â€” but it points to things that should not.

---

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run

From this directory, run `main.py`.  
Inspect the printed dictionary and confirm that every reference looks internally structured **but externally impossible**.

This is the staging point for recursive collapse.
