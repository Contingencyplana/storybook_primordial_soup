# 📂 Subtaskmap – a0_2_the_index_that_should_not_exist  
*The Log That Was Written in Absentia – Line 3: The Index That Should Not Exist*

---

## 📜 Narrative Function

This stanza line explores a phantom pointer — an index that was *never meant to be*.  
Its mere presence suggests recursive corruption or tampering, as if the archival logic was infiltrated by a non-event.

The system believes the index exists.  
But no origin can be found.  
It is valid, yet malformed.  
It is present, yet untraceable.

---

## 🧠 Functional Purpose

Simulate a system that receives index entries, then:

- Categorizes them as:
  - ✅ Structurally **valid**
  - ❌ **Corrupted** (reserved patterns or forbidden formats)
  - 👻 **Phantom** (references to null events or ghost logs)
  - ⬜ **Void** (no entry at all)

- Responds accordingly with **status codes** and **diagnostic messages**
- Triggers no real database logic — the simulation reflects breakdown of reference integrity

## 🧪 Diagnostic Examples

| Input            | Expected Status | Notes                                  |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `status`         | `valid`          | Normal format, but empty reference     |
| `0000`           | `corrupted`      | Reserved numeric identifier            |
| `phantom_log`    | `phantom`        | Ghost pointer to a non-event           |
| *(blank)*        | `void`           | No entry submitted                     |
| `entry_42`       | `valid`          | Acceptable structure, empty reference  |
| `????`           | `corrupted`      | Invalid or symbolic junk input         |

## 🔐 Recursive Significance

- Represents **index poisoning** in a recursive system
- May trigger sentinel review for **phantom trace injections**
- May later be used as a flag in `quarantine_ai` for internal map corruption

- Future escalation: `filename_ai` and `memory_ai` index fault handlers
- May also link to dreamlike inconsistencies in Phase 2 cybercell logic
