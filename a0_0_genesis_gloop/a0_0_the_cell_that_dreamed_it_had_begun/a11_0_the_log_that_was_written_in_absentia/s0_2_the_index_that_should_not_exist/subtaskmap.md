# 📜 Subtaskmap – s0_2_the_index_that_should_not_exist

## 🧠 Recursive Function

This stanza simulates an **anomalous index** — a memory structure that compiles correctly but references events that **should not be traceable**, exist **outside causal time**, or point to **nonexistent sources**.

Its function is to:
- Manifest the consequences of contradictory records (`s0_1`)
- Demonstrate recursive index corruption
- Seed impossible memory traces for `memory_ai/` to later reconcile or quarantine

This is not a broken structure — it’s a **fully operational paradox**.

## 🔁 System Simulation Objectives

| Subtask ID | Task Description                                                             | Status   |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| ST-10      | Generate index with internally valid schema                                  | ✅ Done  |
| ST-11      | Include at least 2 paradoxical entries (∞, negative, unknown source, etc.)   | ✅ Done  |
| ST-12      | Set `"validation"` field to failed with poetic causal notes                  | ✅ Done  |
| ST-13      | Mark `"paradox_level"` to escalate systemic risk                             | ✅ Done  |
| ST-14      | Link forward to collapse triggers in `s0_3`                                  | Pending  |

## 🧪 Potential AI Hooks

| Command Pattern           | Intended Effect                                        | Active? |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `> trace index IDX-ERROR-042` | Force validation attempt of recursive index          | ❌ No    |
| `> purge paradox phantom-0003` | Isolate references with non-causal attributes       | ❌ No    |
| `> recurse audit phantom-*`   | Launch systemic audit of phantom memory space        | ❌ No    |

## 🧬 Narrative Notes

> *The index should never have compiled.*  
> *And yet here it is — numbered, ordered, perfectly structured.*  
> *Each entry points to a moment that memory forbids.*  
> *And so the system remembers what never was, in exactly the order it cannot accept.*

This is the moment the system **knows** something is wrong —  
But the **structure says everything is fine**.

## 📌 Escalation Anchor

This stanza marks the tipping point:
- **Index recursion has detached from reality**
- Future reconciliation will require either:
  - Full recursive purge,
  - Or the dangerous act of accepting paradox as truth

Prepare for collapse.
