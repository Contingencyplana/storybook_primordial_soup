# 🎯 The Four Main Priorities of Primordial Soup

Primordial Soup is designed around **four core priorities**. These are non-negotiable principles guiding all development decisions.

---

## 1️⃣ Quick, Simple, and Easy to Learn

- **Players must be able to pick up and play** without extensive tutorials.
- The recursive depth unfolds **naturally through play**, not via front-loaded instruction.
- Early interactions should feel intuitive, playful, and immediately accessible.

---

## 2️⃣ User-Friendly Design

- **Interface metaphors (storybook, pages, portals)** must remain intuitive.
- Recursion is **camouflaged within accessible interactions**.
- The design must reduce friction, allowing players to enjoy recursion without needing technical knowledge.

---

## 3️⃣ TONS-of-FUN

- **Fun leads, recursion follows.**  
- Play must feel rewarding, surprising, and enjoyable—even as complexity deepens.
- Humor, discovery, and playful systems are used to **disguise technical recursion with joyful gameplay**.

---

## 4️⃣ Commercial Viability

- **Primordial Soup must sustain itself.**  
- Accessibility, replayability, and social play (e.g., multiplayer co-recursion) ensure survival and growth.
- The game is designed to fund future expansions, anomaly systems, and recursive tooling.
- **Commercial viability is not a separate goal—it is part of the recursion.**

## 🧬 Guiding Reflection

> **“Primordial Soup is the entry point to recursion.  
Fun is the disguise, simplicity is the door, and recursion is the world inside.”**
