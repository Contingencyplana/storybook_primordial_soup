**Primordial Soup – Recursive Control Doctrine**  

## 🔑 Purpose

This file defines the **meta-recursive controls** for Primordial Soup’s Phase 2: *Recursive Workflow Awakening*.

It governs how players and systems **build, manage, and extend recursion itself** through interactive commands.

These controls are not gameplay loops—they are **system growth loops**, allowing Primordial Soup to evolve new minigames, nodes, and stanzas **from within its own recursive architecture**.

---

## 🎛️ Core Controls

| Action | Command | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Create Minigame Node** | **Press L** | Generates a **new empty minigame node folder** in the current minigame. Structure: <br> - `__init__.py` <br> - `main.py` <br> - `subtaskmap.md` <br> - `test.py` |
| **Create Minigame (Layer 3)** | **Press R** | Generates a **new minigame folder**, containing: <br> - **4 empty minigame nodes** <br> - `taskmaps/` folder with: <br>  - `README.md` <br>  - `milestones.md` <br>  - `stanzamap.md` <br>  - `taskmap.md` |
| **Exit Current Loop** | **Press ESC** | Exits the current minigame or node. Player returns to the previous recursion layer or the meta-menu. |

## 🔁 Recursive Integrity Principles

1. **4x4 Structure Preserved**  
   - Minigames consist of **4 minigame nodes by default**.  
   - Minigames can contain **multiple Layer 4 stanzas** if recursion demands it.

2. **Player-Guided Recursion Expansion**  
   - Players choose when to grow recursion by invoking `L` and `R`.  
   - Growth is **interactive and reversible**—no forced system bloat.

3. **Playful Tool Creation**  
   - Even meta-recursive tools are **built as playable structures**, not as black-box infrastructure.

4. **Safe Looping and Exits**  
   - Pressing `ESC` preserves breadcrumbs, allowing players to **return to recursion points later without loss of state**.

## ⚙️ Optional Enhancements (Recommended)

| Enhancement | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Context-Aware Prompts** | After pressing `L` or `R`, prompt: *“Do you want to proceed, rename, or return to meta-menu?”* |
| **Breadcrumb System** | Store recursion states to allow safe loop reentry after `ESC`. |
| **Naming Queue** | Allow deferred renaming of files/folders to avoid interrupting recursive flow. |
| **Test Mode Toggle** | Support a **dry-run scaffold mode** where no files are written until confirmed. Useful for simulation and safety testing. |

| File/Folder | Role |
|--------------|-------|
| `meta_recursion_controls/` | Contains **the executable logic** for `L`, `R`, `ESC`. |
| `meta_recursion_controls/taskmap.md` | Tracks **implementation tasks** for building the controls. |
| `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself/` | The **stanza where meta-recursion controls begin.** |

## 🚦 Phase 2 Doctrine Alignment

This system is part of:

- **Phase 2: The Awakening**  
- **Three-Stanza Recursive Automation Arc**

## 🧠 Closing Note

This is **not just a control system**—it is the **recursive engine that grows the recursion itself**.

Changes to this file must be made **carefully and consciously**, as they propagate across all future recursive expansion in Primordial Soup.
