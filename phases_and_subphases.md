# 🌀 Primordial Soup – Phases and Subphases

## Purpose

This file tracks the **recursive evolution of Primordial Soup** in clear, actionable milestones.

Each phase represents a **recursive boundary shift**, and each subphase governs **system maturity checkpoints**.

## 🔁 Phase Map Overview

| Phase   | Subphase | Name | Description |
|---------|----------|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | 1A | Manual Genesis | Hand-built minigames and cybercells |
|         | 1B | Recursive Readiness | First stanza completion & AI prep |
| Phase 2 | 2A | Automation Awakening | Workflow tools (`a15_0`–`a15_3`) |
|         | 2B | Snapshot & Fallback Logic | Introspection tools (`a16_0`–`a16_3`) |
|         | 2C | Anomaly Sandbox (Reserved) | Dashboard prep (`a17_0`–`a17_3`) |
| Phase 3 | 3A | Cybercell Division | First cybercell splits |
|         | 3B | Recursive Autonomy | System spawns new quests/stanzas |
|         | 3C | Oversight Activation | `high_command/`, `quarantine_ai/` awaken |
| Phase 4 | 4A | Multiplayer Awakening | Players join as recursive agents |
