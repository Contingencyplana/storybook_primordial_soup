# ðŸ§­ Layer Definitions for Primordial Soup  
### Understanding Recursive Depth and File Structure

---

## Layer 0 â€” The Game Universe  
- The root folder of a recursive video game project  
- Examples: `Primordial Soup`, `Storybook`, `FUN Factory`  
- May share logic and evolution patterns across games

---

## Layer 1 â€” Cybercell Generation  
- A recursive stanza containing four cybercells  
- Examples: `a0_0_genesis_gloop`, `a1_1_`, `a2_1_`  
- Note: `genesis_gloop` contains **three generations** (1â€“3)

---

## Layer 2 â€” Cybercell  
- A single recursive organism  
- Holds its own functions, memory, and identity  
- Example: `a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun`

---

## Layer 3 â€” Minigame  
- A stanza within the cybercell  
- Composed of four recursive tests, quests, or functions  
- Example: `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself`

---

## Layer 4 â€” Executable Logic Unit ðŸ§¬  
- Python scripts or markdown files that embody a single behavior  
- Examples: `main.py`, `test.py`, `subtaskmap.md`, `field_report.md`

---

## Notes  
- All recursive stanza logic is designed in groups of **four**  
- Each layer contains and refers to the one below it  
- Layering structure is essential for SHAGI-optimized automation and AI traversal
