# 🧬 Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine

## 📘 Definition and Scope

The **Tiny Step Recursion Doctrine** is a foundational design principle of the *Primordial Soup* game engine.  
It governs how recursive systems are scaffolded, tested, and expanded — one **tiny, atomic action at a time**.

This doctrine applies to all:

- Minigame node builders
- Recursive compilers
- System orchestrators
- Fallback engines
- Introspective crawlers

If a system builds or interacts with recursion — it follows this doctrine.

## 🧱 Doctrine Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **One Node = One Action** | Each Layer 4 node performs a single atomic function. |
| **Idempotence** | Nodes can be run multiple times without changing the result. |
| **Self-Testing** | Every node includes its own test file or validation logic. |
| **Traceability** | Each action emits a traceable event with a timestamp. |
| **Rollback Safety** | Steps are isolated to prevent cascading failures. |

---

## 🧠 Compiler Implications

The **meta-recursive compiler** would not function without this doctrine.  
Because each node does only one thing:

- Nodes are safe to reset, rerun, or skip intelligently.
- Recursive orchestration becomes predictable.
- Placeholders are structurally meaningful, not vestigial.
- Toolchains can **enumerate**, **link**, and **validate** components without ambiguity.

Without Tiny Step Recursion, automated systems could not safely evolve.

## 🌱 Systemic Benefits

| Benefit | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| **Predictable Growth** | New nodes follow a pattern and fit the structure. |
| **Flexible Orchestration** | Indexers and compilers can chain tools safely. |
| **Placeholder Integrity** | Reserved nodes are honored by all systems. |
| **Clear Debugging** | Trace logs map precisely to each action. |
| **Tool Reusability** | Builders can be recomposed in multiple workflows. |

## 🚨 Violation Risks

Breaking the doctrine results in:

- **Entangled logic** — hard to test, reuse, or refactor
- **Trace loss** — timestamps and event labels become unreliable
- **Rollback failure** — system cannot safely revert or re-enter
- **Structural drift** — indexes and builders lose sync
- **Recursion collapse** — Phase 3+ introspection and anomaly systems fail

The cost of premature complexity is structural corruption.

## 🧪 Examples in Practice

### ✅ `a15_0_the_compiler_that_built_itself`
Each Layer 4 node:
- Creates one file
- Performs one action
- Tests itself in isolation
- Logs its event to the trace system

### ✅ `a99_0_test_create_minigame_node`
Sandbox validation of tiny step recursion behavior:
- Reset logic
- Traceability
- Folder safety

### ✅ `meta_recursion_controls.md`
Even the compiler’s memory follows the doctrine:
- One entry per node
- One trace per action
- No duplication

## 🔁 Recursive Future

This doctrine is not a Phase 2 convenience — it is a **permanent recursive law**.  
Future systems (e.g., `a16_0`, `a17_2`) will **assume** the doctrine was followed, or they will fail.

It enables:

- Dynamic introspection  
- Recursive growth reflection  
- Safe anomaly simulation  
- Coordinated rollback and reentry

## 📘 Notes

Tiny Step Recursion is **not slow** — it is **safe**.  
By building in atomic layers, the system scales without fragility.

This doctrine ensures *Primordial Soup* remains coherent, extensible, and alive.
