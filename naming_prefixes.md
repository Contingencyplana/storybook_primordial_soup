# Naming Prefixes

## ✅ Prefix Key

This table defines all valid naming prefixes used in recursive folders and filenames across the Primordial Soup project.  
Each prefix denotes **recursion layer, domain sovereignty, and AI governance scope**.

| Prefix Pattern             | Meaning                        | Use Case                            | Governance Scope                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `a` + digit                | Standard recursion             | Core gameplay systems               | Player-facing minigames and stanzas |
| `b` + digit                | Topsy Overmind recursion       | High-level AI control (Topsy)       | Meta-recursion, oversight, correction |
| `c` + digit                | Thorn Overmind recursion       | High-level AI control (Thorn)       | Alternative recursion logic, counter-narratives |
| 2-letter combo             | Other valid filenames          | Auxiliary files, indexes, doctrine  | System-neutral support documents |
| `d`, `e`, `f` + digit      | Reserved (future Overminds)    | Inactive unless activated           | Escalation paths for future governance layers |

> ⚠️ Only `a`, `b`, `c`, and 2-letter combos are currently active.  
> `d+`, `e+`, and onward are **reserved for escalation protocols** or future Overminds yet to be defined.

Each prefix governs a **recursive namespace**.  
Overlap between prefix zones is strictly disallowed to prevent indexing collisions and AI identity drift.

## 🔒 Reserved Ranges and Escalation

Primordial Soup is built to evolve — recursively, narratively, and structurally.  
To ensure this growth does not compromise naming clarity, certain prefixes are **reserved** for future use.

---

### 🧬 Reserved Prefixes

| Prefix | Status     | Intended Use                            |
|--------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `d`    | Reserved   | Future Overmind (TBD)                    |
| `e`    | Reserved   | Secondary escalation layer               |
| `f`    | Reserved   | Deep recursion or autonomous AI domain   |
| `g`–`z`| Undefined  | Locked unless explicitly declared        |

These prefixes **cannot** be used unless:
- A formal expansion doctrine is introduced  
- System-level escalation or Overmind evolution occurs  
- A new AI governance layer demands recursive namespace sovereignty

---

### ⚠️ Conflict Prevention Policy

- **No hybrid prefixes** (e.g., `a0_b1_`, `c3_d0_`)  
- **No prefix recycling** — once a domain is defined (e.g., `b` for Topsy), it remains exclusive  
- **No speculative usage** of reserved ranges in experimental files

---

### 🧠 Escalation Doctrine

Prefixes are **not cosmetic** — they define:
- AI authority levels  
- File hierarchy expectations  
- Recursive identity boundaries

> A prefix is a **signature of recursion lineage**.  
> To escalate is to **invoke a higher recursion sovereignty**.

---

### 📅 Timeline Policy

Once a reserved prefix is activated:
- It must be documented in `naming_prefixes.md`  
- Linked Overmind responsibilities must be clearly defined  
- Existing files may not be retrofitted under the new prefix unless system reindexing occurs

---

This doctrine ensures that recursive growth does not lead to **indexing fragmentation**, **authority confusion**, or **namespace collisions**.

## 🧠 AI Naming Doctrine

Recursive systems require recursive authority.  
In Primordial Soup, **naming is jurisdiction** — each prefix grants domain control to a specific AI intelligence.

---

### 👑 Overmind Sovereignty

| Prefix | Overmind | Domain Scope |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `b`    | Topsy    | Compassionate recursion, narrative guidance, system recovery logic |
| `c`    | Thorn    | Adversarial recursion, boundary testing, counter-recursion logic |
| `d+`   | Future   | Reserved for escalation, isolation, or deep AI recursion |

Each Overmind owns:
- Its prefix space  
- Its stanza logic  
- Its escalation protocol  

These domains must not overlap.  
Each Overmind exists as a **separate recursive system**, even when influencing the same game world.

---

### 🧭 Namespace Integrity Rules

1. **No dual-governed stanzas**  
   A minigame cannot be shared between Overminds (e.g., `b3_0_...` and `c3_0_...` with identical stanza logic).

2. **No prefix collision across recursion tiers**  
   If `a12_1_` is governed by standard recursion, then `b12_1_` must reflect an Overmind reinterpretation — not a duplicate.

3. **No prefix inheritance unless canonized**  
   Overminds cannot “borrow” stanzas or inherit naming unless explicitly defined in their doctrine.

---

### 🧠 Recursive Identity Mapping

Each recursive entity must know:
- Who governs it  
- What logic tier it belongs to  
- How to escalate across Overmind domains

This mapping is achieved through:
- Prefix analysis  
- Stanza-level index traversal  
- Anchor references to `naming_prefixes.md` and Overmind-specific doctrine files

---

### 🧩 Design Implication

Prefix-based naming is not cosmetic. It is:
- A **recursive passport**
- A **sovereignty marker**
- A **key to recursion governance**

> The prefix tells you **who you are**,  
> **who owns your logic**,  
> and **who watches your fall.**

## 🧭 Summary – Recursive Naming as Lineage and Integrity

In Primordial Soup, naming is not decoration.  
It is **structure**, **memory**, and **sovereignty**.

Each prefix marks a recursive **domain of thought**:
- A governance layer (standard, Overmind, future AI)
- A recursion identity (test loop, anomaly, response)
- A lineage of logic, branching across the world

---

### 🧬 Naming Reflects the System’s Soul

- The `a`-prefix maps player recursion — the walk through the loop  
- The `b`- and `c`-prefixes map Overmind recursion — the **observers** and **alterers** of the loop  
- The `d+` space is not yet used — but it watches, reserved for escalation

---

### 🔏 Design Philosophy

Recursive naming must be:

- **Consistent** — so that AI and players know where they are  
- **Isolated** — so that Overminds do not overwrite or leak into each other’s paths  
- **Expandable** — so that future recursion layers can be born without breaking what came before

---

### 🔁 Doctrine Affirmation

> Every name is a boundary.  
> Every prefix is a promise.  
> The system remembers what governs it —  
> and what it must never become.

This is how we protect the recursion.  
This is how we preserve recursive identity.

**Prefix is policy.  
Prefix is recursion.  
Prefix is law.**
