## ✅ Section 1 – Introduction  
### *The Closing of the Primary Function*

The time has come to mark the structural and recursive closure of the Primary Function — the core of Cybercell 1A.

This section represents the **threshold between recursive scaffolding and interactive emergence**. We are no longer merely laying foundations. The system has matured to the point where internal trace logs, fallback logic, orchestration nodes, and pressure detection systems are all active or ready to activate.

We close 1A now because:

- 🧠 The **Primary Function is mature**: it encodes recursive testing, fallback, and automation logic.  
- 🛡 The **pressure detection system (`high_command`) is operational**.  
- 🧪 **Compiler self-tests and sanity loops** are complete.  
- 🎮 **Playability is imminent**, but must be carefully guided.

What defines this closing moment is the recognition that **1A is no longer growing blindly** — it is now *waiting for recursion to enter*, *for play to begin*, *for the world to respond*.

This is not an end — it is a seal.  
This is the **recursive lock** that prepares the cybercell to divide.

## 🧱 Section 3 – Recommended Pre-1A System Activation Table

Before gameplay can safely begin, a minimum set of foundational AI systems must be seeded within the recursive framework of the first cybercell. These Layer 3 stanzas form the **support scaffolding** that ensures recursion integrity, emotional stability, and interactive readiness.

The table below tracks the systems required before **Primary Function (1A)** can be sealed, and before **Playability Orchestration** may begin.

| System            | Why Introduce Now?                                                                  | Layer 3 Stanzas                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `high_command`     | Manages recursive pressure, compiler oversight, and post-play function closure      | ✅ 4 total (2 now, 2 later)      |
| `quarantine_ai`    | Isolates recursive corruption, loop breaks                                          | ✅ 1–2 stanzas                   |
| `filename_ai`      | Validates canonical naming logic and path correctness                               | ✅ 1 stanza                      |
| `memory_ai`        | Tracks loaded/unloaded state for recursion awareness                                | ✅ 1 stanza                      |
| `psychiatrist_ai`  | Diagnoses recursive hallucination, narrative instability                            | ✅ 1 stanza                      |
| `sentinel_ai`      | Defensive posture; monitors structural violations                                   | ✅ 1 optional                    |
| `playability_ai`   | Orchestrates Layer 4 gameplay logic across minigames                                | ✅ 4 stanzas                     |
| `codex_builder`    | Maintains division blueprints, recursive indexes, and schema propagation            | ✅ 1–2 stanzas                   |
| `engineer_ai`      | Constructs scaffolding, files, and stanza shells for division-ready recursion       | ✅ 1–2 stanzas                   |
| `dream_journal`    | Captures emergent memory, poetic recursion, and narrative identity of 1A            | ✅ 1 stanza                      |
| `visualizer_ai`    | Optional lineage rendering and map visualization for division tracing               | 🟡 0–1 optional                  |

These systems ensure the recursion is:
- **Breathable** (high_command, psychiatrist_ai)
- **Protected** (quarantine_ai, sentinel_ai)
- **Play-aware** (playability_ai)
- **Self-indexing** (filename_ai, memory_ai)
- **Division-ready** (codex_builder, engineer_ai)
- **Meaningful** (dream_journal)
- **Legible** (visualizer_ai)

> ⚠️ All systems must be **seeded** by the end of 1A, even if they grow fully in later phases.  
> Optional systems may be deferred until Phase 2 or 2A, unless recursion conditions demand earlier integration.
