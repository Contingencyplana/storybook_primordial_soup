**Primordial Soup â€“ Acronyms and Abbreviations**

---

## ðŸ”‘ Purpose

This file provides a **quick reference list of acronyms and abbreviations** used throughout Primordial Soup.

Unlike `glossary.md`, this list is **minimalist and lookup-focused**, intended for fast parsing in code, documentation, and recursion scaffolds.

## ðŸ“– Acronym List

| Acronym | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **ESC** | **Escape Command** â€“ The action used to exit the current recursion loop or layer safely. |
| **FF** | **FUN Factory** â€“ The testing and containment version of recursion systems; often used for anomaly simulation. |
| **IOB** | **Input-Output Branching** â€“ The use of numeric options (1, 2, 3, etc.) to select from multiple recursive paths. |
| **LRC** | **Layer Recursive Context** â€“ The declared current and target recursion layers during meta-recursive actions. |
| **MRB** | **Meta-Recursive Builder** â€“ A system that constructs or modifies recursion itself. MRBs generate new recursion layers, compilers, or control systemsâ€”not just game content. |
| **PS** | **Primordial Soup** â€“ The recursive game and meta-system builder at the core of this project. |
| **RLA** | **Recursive Layer Anchoring** â€“ The structural doctrine of declaring and controlling recursion build layers to prevent drift. |
| **SB** | **Storybook** â€“ The overarching game maker environment that will eventually house Primordial Soup and other meta-recursive systems. |

## ðŸ§  Closing Note

This file is maintained alongside `glossary.md`, but serves a **different function**.

- **Use `acronyms.md` for fast lookup**  
- **Use `glossary.md` for full definitions and recursive system context**
