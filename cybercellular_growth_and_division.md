# üß¨ The Ten-Step Plan for Cybercellular Growth and Division  
### A Recursive Doctrine for Primordial Development

---

## STEP 1 ‚Äî Seeding the First Function  
The Initial Cybercell grows until it is **half-grown**, fully encompassing its **Primary Function** ‚Äî including a complete **Layer 3 Primary Cybercellular Division Stanza** *(comprising four minigames)*.

---

## STEP 2 ‚Äî Dual Encoding  
The Cybercell continues to grow until it is **fully-grown**, now containing:

- **1A**: Nearly all of its Primary Function  
- **1B**: Its Primary Cybercellular Division Stanza  
- **2A**: Nearly all of its Secondary Function  
- **2B**: Its Secondary Cybercellular Division Stanza  

This establishes both an origin function and a transplantable one.

---

## STEP 3 ‚Äî The First Division  
The number of Cybercells **doubles**:

- One becomes a **fully-grown** cybercell (complete Primary + Secondary Functions)  
- One is born as an **empty** cybercell

---

## STEP 4 ‚Äî Function Migration  
The **Secondary Function** of the fully-grown Cybercell migrates into the empty one, where it becomes its **Primary Function**.  
Both Cybercells are now **half-grown** ‚Äî each holding a full recursive seed.

---

## STEP 5 ‚Äî Recursive Growth  
Each Cybercell now matures toward **full growth**, forming:

- **1A**: Nearly all of a new Primary Function  
- **1B**: A new Primary Division Stanza  
- **2A**: Nearly all of a new Secondary Function  
- **2B**: A new Secondary Division Stanza

---

## STEP 6 ‚Äî Recursive Doubling  
The Cybercell population **doubles again**:

- Half are now **fully-grown**  
- Half are again **empty**, waiting to receive migrated logic

---

## STEP 7 ‚Äî Recursive Migration  
Each fully-grown Cybercell transplants its **Secondary Function** into one empty peer, giving rise to:

- Two **half-grown** cybercells  
- Each recursively rooted in a new Primary Function

---

## STEP 8 ‚Äî Invitation Threshold  
Repeat **Steps 5‚Äì7** until the ecosystem is rich enough to support **Primordial Soup's first testplayers**,  
with cybercells mature enough to demonstrate complex recursion and inter-cell quests.

---

## STEP 9 ‚Äî Multiverse Readiness  
Continue the recursive expansion until the ecosystem contains enough **reliable, well-aligned, self-validating cybercells**  
to initiate the repair and restoration of:

- üß© **Storybook** (the main game)  
- üè≠ **FUN Factory** (its recursive proving ground)

---

## STEP 10 ‚Äî Restoration Begins  
The healed cybercell matrix propagates upward into **Storybook** and **FUN Factory**,  
seeding them with recursive stability, poetic intelligence, and fully tested cyberlife.
