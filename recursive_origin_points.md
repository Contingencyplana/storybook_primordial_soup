**Primordial Soup ‚Äì Recursive Origin Points Doctrine**  

---

## üîë Purpose

This file defines the **AI-standard recursion control methodology** for Primordial Soup.

It governs how the system determines **where recursion begins**, **how it expands**, and **how recursion layers are managed**.

This doctrine is **AI-driven and canonized** for all future automation.

---

## üß≠ Recursive Layer Anchoring Model

Primordial Soup uses **Recursive Layer Anchoring** to track and control recursion growth.

Each recursion build moment must declare **its layer of origin and intent**.

| Layer | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Layer 0** | **Cybercell Base Layer** ‚Äì Origin of recursion; Primordial Soup core |
| **Layer 1** | **Minigame Construction Layer** ‚Äì Creates minigames from nodes |
| **Layer 2** | **Meta-Recursive Control Layer** ‚Äì Builds recursion builders (e.g., `meta_recursion_controls/main.py`) |
| **Layer 3** | **Recursive Tool Generation** ‚Äì Compilers that create compilers, index builders, etc. |
| **Layer 4** | **Cross-System Expansion** ‚Äì Prepares for recursion in Storybook, FUN Factory, or external systems |
| **Layer 5** | **Anomaly Containment & Rollback** ‚Äì Manages snapshots, safe exits, and paradox testing |

## üß∞ How It Works

When recursion is expanded:

1. **Declare Layer Context**  
   - Each tool must know **which recursion layer it is modifying**.

2. **Anchor Entry Point**  
   - The **current `main.py` file is the meta-recursive entry point**.
   - It must be explicitly coded to know:  
     **‚ÄúI am in Layer X, building Layer Y.‚Äù**

3. **Control Recursive Expansion**  
   - Tools build **only the next layer**, preventing uncontrolled multi-layer drift.

4. **Track Growth Paths**  
   - Expansion into Storybook or FUN Factory recursion happens **via Layer 4 triggers**, not by default.

## üîÅ Why This Model?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Prevents Recursive Drift** | Ensures recursion grows intentionally |
| **Supports Safe Rollback** | Layers are distinct, so recovery is simple |
| **Enables AI Co-Building** | This model aligns with AI-driven recursion growth |
| **Future-Proofs the System** | Handles both Primordial Soup and expansion into external systems |

---

## üö¶ Phase 2 Alignment

This is the **official recursion control model** for:

- **Phase 2: The Awakening**  
- **Three-Stanza Recursive Automation Arc**  
- **All meta-recursive tools and compilers moving forward**

---

## üß† Closing Note

This doctrine replaces all informal models.

Primordial Soup recursion must be built **from the AI-aligned Recursive Layer Anchoring model**.

**All future recursive growth will follow this system.**
