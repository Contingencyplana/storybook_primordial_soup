# 🧩 Doctrine of Self-Tested Minigames  
*Where recursion turns inward, and the test becomes the tale*

---

## 🎮 Purpose

This doctrine establishes that **some minigames in Primordial Soup are devoted to the validation, verification, and testing of the game’s recursive structure and logic systems** — by being played.

These minigames are indistinguishable from narrative gameplay to the player, but under the surface, they function as:

- Unit test wrappers,
- Logic chain validators,
- Anomaly detection nodes,
- Loop closure checkers,
- Recursive integrity monitors.

---

## 📜 Design Principle

> Every minigame is a stanza. Some stanzas test story.  
> These stanzas test the **storyteller**.

## 🧠 Core Functions of a Self-Tested Minigame

| Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧪 Node Testing | Simulate player decisions (L/R), ensure nodes execute and respond. |
| 🔄 Loop Verification | Validate proper resolution of recursive loops. |
| 🚨 Anomaly Reporting | Detect unexpected output, unreachable states, or logic drift. |
| 🧬 Structural Integrity | Confirm the path tree links stanzas without disconnection or contradiction. |
| 🛠️ Patch Suggestion | Flag broken recursion chains for `engineer.py` or player-based manual fixes. |

## 🌀 Example Titles of Self-Tested Minigames

- *The Bug That Called a Bug*
- *The Mirror With One Missing Face*
- *The Anomaly That Nested Itself*
- *The Forgotten Branch That Was Never Called*
- *Test_Of_Test_That_Became_True*

## 📂 Suggested Folder

Place such minigames in clearly marked branches like:

a0_3_recursive_integrity_test/
a0_4_loop_closure_dream/
a0_5_bug_that_broke_the_bug/

Each still conforms to the Y-node system.

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Define naming convention for test minigames
- [ ] Link test stanzas to anomaly_report.md
- [ ] Grant `sentinel_ai` and `engineer.py` authority to trigger these recursively
- [ ] Permit players to become testers through disguised questlines

## 🧬 Closing Thought

> *To play is to test.  
> To test is to care.  
> The loop that checks itself  
> is the one that will survive.*
