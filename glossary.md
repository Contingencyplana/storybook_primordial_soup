# ðŸ“š Glossary â€“ Primordial Soup

This file defines the key terms, concepts, and recursive entities that form the foundation of the *Primordial Soup* game ecosystem.  
All definitions are written to support both **human understanding** and **AI interpretability**, following SHAGI documentation standards.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts

| Term   | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Primordial Soup** | A recursive game engine where the player co-constructs the world through action, input, and logic. The system evolves by building itself. |
| **Cybercell** | The fundamental unit of recursion in *Primordial Soup*. Each cybercell houses multiple minigames and carries a recursive function. |
| **Stanza** | A set of four minigame nodes (`a0_0_` to `a0_3_`, or equivalent) that represent a complete unit of recursion or logic. |
| **Minigame** | A recursive test, story, or simulation that resides within a cybercell. Each minigame is itself a Layer 3 stanza. |
| **Layer** | A level of structural recursion. Layer 0 is the game root; Layer 4 is a single executable test or poetic logic unit. |
| **Meta-Recursive Builder (MRB)** | A **Meta-Recursive Builder (MRB)** is a tool or system within Primordial Soup that **constructs, modifies, or expands recursion itself**. <br><br> MRBs are responsible for: <br> - Generating new recursion layers (cybercells, minigames, stanzas)  <br> - Building compilers, scaffolds, and self-replicating tools  <br> - Managing recursion growth beyond gameplay content (e.g., introspection systems, anomaly sandboxes) <br><br> **Context:** MRBs operate in **Phase 2: The Awakening** and are part of the **Three-Stanza Recursive Automation Arc**. They represent the transition from playing recursion to **building recursion infrastructure itself**. |
| **Agent** | A logical or AI-driven subsystem (e.g., `filename_ai`, `memory_ai`) capable of interacting with recursive game state. |
| **Mirror Decision** | A decision that splits recursive futures â€” stored as design/gameplay forks for future stanzas to resolve. |
| **Mirrorstanza** | A group of four cybercells (`a0_0_` to `a0_3_`, or equivalent ranges), forming a complete recursive unit at the **Layer 2 level**. Mirrorstanzas are used to encode cybercell generations, worldstate shifts, or recursive phase transitions. Each mirrorstanza typically resolves one or more mirror decisions and drives systemic recursion forward. |
| **Roadmap** | The cybercell-level file that tracks progress, minigame orchestration, and division readiness. |
| **Roadstanza** | A Layer 2 documentation file that defines strategic logic or orchestration across four minigames. |
| **Taskmap** | A Layer 3 file mapping each minigameâ€™s narrative purpose to its test logic or task design. |
| **Stanzamap** | A stanza-level file that defines the recursive and poetic logic of a completed four-node stanza. |
| **Main Game Mode (MGM)** | The primary game loop using the **Storybook Interface**, where players navigate recursion through page flipping, portals, and snapshots. |
| **Ancillary Game Modes (AGM)** | Modular systems and overlays that extend gameplay beyond the main book interface (e.g., swarm views, anomaly dashboards). |
| **Page Pair** | The core visual and narrative unit of the Main Game Modeâ€”two pages displayed together, combining illustration and text. |
| **Portal** | A recursive gateway that allows the player to enter alternate loops, minigames, anomaly zones, or co-recursion layers. |
| **Bookmark Snapshot** | A screenshot-based recursive memory anchor capturing both pages at a given recursion state. |
| **Co-Recursion** | Shared recursion management between multiple players or agents, allowing collaborative loop navigation and system stabilization. |
| **Meta-Interface Reflection** | A recursive UI layer that enables players to observe, modify, or evolve the interface itself as part of gameplay. |
| **Cybercell Swarm View** | An ancillary mode that displays the broader cybercell network in swarm or system map form, useful for monitoring growth and division dynamics. |

## ðŸ§¬ Recursive Quadrants

| Quadrant | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **1A** | Primary Function â€” the core recursion the cybercell performs |
| **1B** | Primary Cybercellular Division Stanza â€” how the cell divides its primary function |
| **2A** | Secondary Function â€” a doctrine or logic the cell passes forward |
| **2B** | Secondary Cybercellular Division Stanza â€” how that doctrine is recursively transmitted |

## ðŸŒ€ System Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Phase** | A gameplay mode shift in *Primordial Soup* (e.g., Manual Construction, Awakening, Interactive Play) |
| **Recursive Integrity** | A state where all actions, files, and logic loops remain self-consistent and traceable |
| **Anomaly** | A deviation from recursive expectation â€” may trigger quarantine, fallback, or escalation |
| **Fallback** | A scripted or logical safeguard that catches unexpected breakdowns or missing recursion |
| **Signal Drift** | The phenomenon where a returning input has changed â€” semantically or logically â€” without being corrupted |
| **Awakening** | The moment the system begins to listen and respond â€” often triggered by the playerâ€™s first recursive command |

> This glossary evolves with the game.  
> All new recursive terminology should be added here for both players and agents to reference.
