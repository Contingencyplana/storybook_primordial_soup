# ðŸ“š Glossary â€“ Primordial Soup

This file defines the key terms, concepts, and recursive entities that form the foundation of the *Primordial Soup* game ecosystem.  
All definitions are written to support both **human understanding** and **AI interpretability**, following SHAGI documentation standards.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Primordial Soup** | A recursive game engine where the player co-constructs the world through action, input, and logic. The system evolves by building itself. |
| **Cybercell** | The fundamental unit of recursion in *Primordial Soup*. Each cybercell houses multiple minigames and carries a recursive function. |
| **Stanza** | A set of four minigame nodes (`s0_0_` to `s0_3_`) that represent a complete unit of recursion or logic. |
| **Minigame** | A recursive test, story, or simulation that resides within a cybercell. Each minigame is itself a Layer 3 stanza. |
| **Layer** | A level of structural recursion. Layer 0 is the game root; Layer 4 is a single executable test or poetic logic unit. |
| **Agent** | A logical or AI-driven subsystem (e.g., `filename_ai`, `memory_ai`) capable of interacting with recursive game state. |
| **Mirror Decision** | A decision that splits recursive futures â€” stored as design/gameplay forks for future stanzas to resolve. |
| **Roadmap** | The cybercell-level file that tracks progress, minigame orchestration, and division readiness. |
| **Roadstanza** | A Layer 2 documentation file that defines strategic logic or orchestration across multiple minigames. |
| **Taskmap** | A Layer 3 file mapping each minigameâ€™s narrative purpose to its test logic or task design. |
| **Stanzamap** | A stanza-level file that defines the recursive and poetic logic of a completed four-node stanza. |

## ðŸ§¬ Recursive Quadrants

| Quadrant | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **1A** | Primary Function â€” the core recursion the cybercell performs |
| **1B** | Primary Cybercellular Division Stanza â€” how the cell divides its primary function |
| **2A** | Secondary Function â€” a doctrine or logic the cell passes forward |
| **2B** | Secondary Cybercellular Division Stanza â€” how that doctrine is recursively transmitted |

## ðŸŒ€ System Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Phase** | A gameplay mode shift in *Primordial Soup* (e.g., Manual Construction, Awakening, Interactive Play) |
| **Recursive Integrity** | A state where all actions, files, and logic loops remain self-consistent and traceable |
| **Anomaly** | A deviation from recursive expectation â€” may trigger quarantine, fallback, or escalation |
| **Fallback** | A scripted or logical safeguard that catches unexpected breakdowns or missing recursion |
| **Signal Drift** | The phenomenon where a returning input has changed â€” semantically or logically â€” without being corrupted |
| **Awakening** | The moment the system begins to listen and respond â€” often triggered by the playerâ€™s first recursive command |

> This glossary evolves with the game.  
> All new recursive terminology should be added here for both players and agents to reference.
