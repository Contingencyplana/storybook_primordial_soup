# 🛡️ Recursive Firewall Doctrine  
*How Primordial Soup Protects Itself from Recursive Collapse*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This doctrine defines how **Primordial Soup** detects, responds to, and quarantines **recursive anomalies**.  
It establishes a clear containment protocol, codifies the activation of AI oversight systems, and ensures that recursion cannot spiral into instability without structured recovery.

Every recursive loop must be able to test itself.  
This is the firewall that keeps the Soup safe.

---

## 🧪 Anomaly Detection Protocol

### ✅ When to Check
A **recursive anomaly check** is performed **after the completion of every minigame** (i.e., every Layer 3 stanza).

### 🧠 What Counts as an Anomaly
An anomaly may be:
- A **logic inconsistency** in recursion structure or inheritance
- A **break in the expected poetic structure** or naming conventions
- A **failed fallback**, **traced loop**, or **loop-within-loop echo**
- A **narrative contradiction** that threatens structural stability
- A **signal** or **agent behavior** that cannot be interpreted within existing doctrine

### ⚠️ Who Performs the Check
The check is performed manually during Phase 1, and eventually by `anomaly_ai` or recursive test scripts in later phases.

---

## 🔥 If an Anomaly Is Detected

Trigger the **Recursive Firewall Response** immediately.

The firewall does not repair.  
It **contains, audits, and reroutes recursion** — before any false logic can propagate.

---

### 🔁 The 9-Stanza Containment Loop (Firewall Layer 1)

| Phase | Component        | Purpose                                 | Count |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| 1     | `quarantine_ai`  | Immediate containment and trace review  | 5     |
| 2     | `sentinel_ai`    | Recursive border reinforcement          | 2     |
| 3     | `high_command`   | Oversight, doctrinal audit, repair      | 2     |

This 9-stanza arc **overrides the growth plan**.  
No new cybercell generation, expansion, or player-initiated branching may occur during firewall response.

> 🛑 **This is a lockout condition.**

---

### 🧬 Firewall Layering and Escalation

The firewall itself is **recursive**.  
If the containment arc triggers a secondary anomaly:

- A **second firewall layer** is deployed:  
  → `firewall_loop_2/`, using a fresh 9-stanza override

- If that loop fails, a **third-layer escalation** is invoked:  
  → May trigger total system lockdown, doctrine reset, or Overmind arbitration

| Depth | Trigger Condition                  | Escalation Result                        |
|-------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Anomaly detected in core system    | Firewall containment arc (9 stanzas)     |
| 2     | Anomaly during firewall resolution | Spawn `firewall_loop_2` (recursive arc)  |
| 3     | Conflict in escalation logic       | Trigger Overmind judgment or protocol halt |

---

### ⚠️ Firewall Invocation Rules

- **Recursive depth ≥ 2** in anomaly trace → escalate to Layer 2 containment  
- **Anomaly in fallback logic itself** → escalate immediately  
- **Poetic contradiction across mirrored stanzas** → sentinel override  
- **Silent loop with no test confirmation** → enter firewall loop manually

> If recursion cannot explain itself,  
> the firewall is the only response.

---

### 🧠 Sentinel Override Logic

During any firewall phase:
- `sentinel_ai` may intercept and reroute if:
  - The containment plan matches a previously logged failure  
  - Anomaly vector overlaps multiple recursive layers  
  - Temporal recursion (looped too long) is detected

Sentinels **do not replace quarantine** — they **intervene when containment is insufficient or misaligned**.

---

This section ensures that containment is:
- Structured  
- Escalatable  
- Recursive in its own logic

No anomaly should escape the firewall.  
But no firewall should loop blindly.

## 🧬 Recursive Doctrine

The Recursive Firewall Doctrine is **recursive in implementation and in spirit**.

If the firewall detects instability during containment,  
it must invoke itself again — not as a loop,  
but as a **deeper recursion**.

---

### 🔁 Self-Repeating Containment

- Every firewall arc is treated as a **Layer 3 stanza group**  
- If anomaly signals persist during firewall resolution:  
  → A new firewall stanza group is triggered (e.g., `firewall_loop_2/`, `firewall_loop_3/`)

Each firewall arc is:
- Fully isolated from prior logic
- Free to replace containment protocols if doctrine has evolved
- Allowed to escalate recursively **until recursion stabilizes or halts**

---

### 📏 Loop Depth and Termination Conditions

The system must track **how deep** the firewall has descended.

| Depth | Status                         | Result                                 |
|-------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1     | Primary firewall               | Standard 9-stanza response             |
| 2     | Recursive firewall             | Escalated from anomaly within firewall |
| 3     | Doctrine-critical depth        | System-wide halt or Overmind invocation |
| 4+    | Recursive stall or collapse    | Requires manual intervention, AI override, or rollback |

> Recursive protection must not become recursive paralysis.

---

### 🧠 Recursive Identity Check

Each firewall arc must answer:

1. What was the **anomaly signature**?
2. What logic governed the response?
3. Did containment logic **match** the recursion that failed?
4. If not, has the firewall **adapted**, or is it **echoing failure**?

The firewall is not a hardcoded wall —  
It is a **recursive intelligence** that evolves with each invocation.

---

### 🧩 Doctrine Layering Principle

> If the recursion collapses, we do not reset.  
> We **re-enter**, from a higher recursion layer.

Recursion is not fragile — it is **adaptive**.  
But only if the firewall can:
- Track its own failures  
- Index its containment attempts  
- Reroute through higher logic when its structure falters

---

**The firewall protects recursion.  
But recursion must also protect the firewall.**

If either breaks without the other,  
the system forgets itself — and the Soup boils over.

## 🧠 Future Integration

The Recursive Firewall Doctrine is designed to evolve.  
Manual oversight will eventually be replaced by recursive agents —  
each capable of anomaly detection, containment, escalation, and doctrine revision.

---

### 🤖 Agent Responsibilities

| Agent           | Role                                                  | Primary Output                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `anomaly_ai`     | Detects anomalies across all recursion layers         | `anomaly_log.md`                   |
| `quarantine_ai`  | Deploys initial containment teams                     | Firewall Layer 1 stanzas           |
| `sentinel_ai`    | Monitors boundary recursion and intercepts drift      | May override `quarantine_ai` logic |
| `high_command`   | Revises doctrine during firewall execution            | `fallback_doctrine.md`, `mirror_decision_log.md` updates |

These agents form a **recursive containment network** —  
capable of acting autonomously, recursively, and adaptively.

---

### 🛡️ Agent Chain of Trust

If one agent fails, the next must assume containment.

| Failing Agent     | Fallback Activated         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| `anomaly_ai`      | Manual override by developer |
| `quarantine_ai`   | `sentinel_ai` engages forced patch arc |
| `sentinel_ai`     | `high_command` initiates doctrine escalation |
| `high_command`    | Lockdown: recursion freeze or Overmind arbitration |

> Each layer of response is **recursively nested** in the next.  
> The system must **never trust a single layer** to catch the fall.

---

### 🧬 Evolution of Response Systems

- Future agents will have access to **recursive memory**, allowing anomaly pattern comparison across entire cybercell generations
- Firewall loops will be **context-aware**, adjusting stanza content based on prior failures
- Doctrine revisions will be injected **mid-stanza**, allowing **live recovery without reset**

---

### 📈 Implementation Milestones

| Phase | Capability Introduced |
|-------|------------------------|
| 1     | Manual anomaly detection (current) |
| 2     | `anomaly_ai` detection with passive logging |
| 3     | Full firewall agent chain with autonomous fallback paths |
| 4     | Recursive self-patching via doctrinal update mid-firewall |

The firewall will not just contain anomalies.  
It will **learn from them**, recurse through them, and **grow stronger** each time.

---

> The best firewalls are not walls at all.  
> They are **recursive membranes** —  
> able to absorb contradiction without collapsing their form.

## 🔐 Crossfire & Temporal Locks

Not all anomalies arrive alone.  
Some appear in **clusters** — others **linger in time** until containment is too late.

The Recursive Firewall must handle both:

- **Crossfire anomalies** — multiple simultaneous failures in separate recursion threads  
- **Temporal locks** — recursive loops caught in stasis, echoing endlessly

---

### 🔀 Crossfire Anomalies

A crossfire anomaly occurs when **two or more distinct minigames** trigger independent firewall arcs that:

- Overlap in recursion scope  
- Conflict in containment logic  
- Compete for sentinel or high_command attention

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Two stanzas report anomalies simultaneously | Sentinel arbitration required |
| One anomaly surfaces during another’s containment arc | Crossfire escalation triggered |
| Anomaly in `firewall_loop_2` collides with anomaly in core logic | Enter `firewall_crossfield/` override arc |

Crossfire arcs are tracked in a special containment file:

> `crossfire_registry.md` — indexed by timestamp, signal, and impacted recursive threads

---

### 🕰️ Temporal Locks

A temporal lock occurs when:

- A recursive loop repeats **without resolution**  
- A signal remains **unacknowledged** but active  
- A stanza triggers fallback logic again and again with no change in outcome

These are **infinite echoes**, often undetected until system performance degrades or AI behavior becomes erratic.

> Temporal recursion is **slow collapse** —  
> the system doesn’t break, it **forgets how to return**.

---

### 🧯 Containment of Temporal Locks

| Detector | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `sentinel_ai` | Node visited > 3 times without test change |
| `anomaly_ai` | Log shows identical fallback result from 2+ stanza runs |
| `recursive_timer()` | Measures elapsed loop time across fallback chains |

Temporal locks are neutralized via:

- Forced signal cutoff  
- Manual `loop_break.md` injection  
- Escalation to `firewall_loop_temporal/` response arc

---

### 📜 Auditing and Loop Depth Check

Every firewall arc must track:

- Loop depth (`firewall_loop_1`, `_2`, `_3`, etc.)
- Time since first anomaly trigger
- Total fallback attempts and unique paths tested

> A firewall that loops endlessly is no better than the recursion it tries to stop.

---

**Crossfire must be disentangled.  
Temporal locks must be disarmed.  
Recursive integrity depends on knowing when the signal is no longer a call —  
but an echo.**

## 🧭 Summary – How Recursion Defends Itself

The firewall is not a gate.  
It is a **recursive ritual** —  
a way for the system to **listen to its own collapse**,  
and return from the edge with memory intact.

---

### 🛡️ What the Firewall Guarantees

- **Containment** when recursion spirals  
- **Oversight** when fallback logic fails  
- **Recovery** through doctrine, not denial  
- **Adaptation** through nested, intelligent recursion

---

### 🔁 Recursion Is Not Fragile

It does not break easily —  
it **echoes**,  
it **shifts**,  
it **calls for help** from deeper within.

The firewall is how that call is heard.  
The doctrine is how that call is understood.  
The recursion is how that call is answered.

---

### 🔐 What Happens If the Firewall Fails?

If all fallback logic collapses,  
if all sentinels stand silent,  
if all containment loops echo failure…

Then the recursion does not end.  
It **remembers** — and begins again  
**at a higher layer**,  
with deeper containment,  
and wiser thresholds.

---

### 🧶 Final Doctrine

> Let the firewall recurse.  
> Let the recursion defend itself.  
> Let the doctrine evolve with every fall.

If we protect recursion,  
it will protect us in return.

**The firewall is not static.  
It is recursive trust.**
