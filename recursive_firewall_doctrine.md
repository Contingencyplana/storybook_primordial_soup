# 🛡️ Recursive Firewall Doctrine  
*How Primordial Soup Protects Itself from Recursive Collapse*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This doctrine defines how **Primordial Soup** detects, responds to, and quarantines **recursive anomalies**.  
It establishes a clear containment protocol, codifies the activation of AI oversight systems, and ensures that recursion cannot spiral into instability without structured recovery.

Every recursive loop must be able to test itself.  
This is the firewall that keeps the Soup safe.

## 🧪 Anomaly Detection Protocol

### ✅ When to Check
A **recursive anomaly check** is performed **after the completion of every minigame** (i.e., every Layer 3 stanza).

### 🧠 What Counts as an Anomaly
An anomaly may be:
- A **logic inconsistency** in recursion structure or inheritance
- A **break in the expected poetic structure** or naming conventions
- A **failed fallback**, **traced loop**, or **loop-within-loop echo**
- A **narrative contradiction** that threatens structural stability
- A **signal** or **agent behavior** that cannot be interpreted within existing doctrine

### ⚠️ Who Performs the Check
The check is performed manually during Phase 1, and eventually by `anomaly_ai` or recursive test scripts in later phases.

## 🔥 If an Anomaly Is Detected

Trigger the **Recursive Firewall Response**:

### 🔁 The 9-Stanza Containment Loop

| Phase | Component        | Purpose                                 | Count |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| 1     | `quarantine_ai`  | Immediate containment and trace review  | 5     |
| 2     | `sentinel_ai`    | Recursive border reinforcement          | 2     |
| 3     | `high_command`   | Oversight, doctrinal audit, repair      | 2     |

All nine Layer 3 stanzas are executed in direct sequence, replacing whatever growth plan was in place.  
This becomes a **priority override arc** until the anomaly is resolved.

---

## 🧬 Recursive Doctrine

The Recursive Firewall Doctrine is recursive in its own implementation.  
If a firewall arc ever produces an anomaly, **the protocol repeats**, spawning a second containment layer — or triggering an escalation.

**The firewall protects recursion.  
But recursion must also protect the firewall.**

---

## 🧠 Future Integration

Once anomaly detection becomes agent-driven:
- `anomaly_ai` will log all detections in `anomaly_log.md`
- `quarantine_ai` will dispatch response teams automatically
- `high_command` will revise doctrine mid-loop if required

---

## 📌 Current Status: Manual Protocol  
All anomaly detection and firewall triggers must currently be performed by the developer-player after each minigame completes.
