# 🌊 Primordial Soup  
*A Text-Based Recursive Game That Grows Until It Can Build Itself*

---

## 📖 Concept Summary

Primordial Soup begins as a single recursive seed:  
a lone folder (`a0_0_genesis_gloop/`) representing the **First Cybercell Generation**, containing its first playable cell:

a0_0_genesis_gloop/
└── a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun/

Inside this cybercell are several **minigames**, each structured as recursive stanzas.  
Players — starting with the creator — interact with these games by feeding them input, exploring output, solving recursive puzzles, and unlocking branching logic.

Once a cybercell has absorbed enough meaningful interaction, it **cyber-cellularly divides** — forming two new cybercells (folders), each capable of further recursive growth.

As recursion deepens, players increasingly build new functionality *from within the game itself* — by completing logic loops, naming paths, invoking AI agents, or traversing portals.

At full maturity, Primordial Soup becomes recursive enough to repair the **Storybook** and **FUN Factory** universes from which it originated.

## 🧪 Core Gameplay Loop

1. Begin with a single generation:  
   `a0_0_genesis_gloop/`  
   └── `a0_0_the_cell_that_dreamed_it_had_begun/`

2. Inside are minigames such as:  
   `a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself/`  
   `a0_1_side_quest_of_the_forgotten_loop/`

3. Each minigame is structured as:
- A `taskmaps/` folder (`taskmap.md`, `stanzamap_#.md`)
- Four stanza nodes (`s0_0`, `s0_1`, ..., `s0_3`)
- Each node has `main.py`, `test.py`, and an optional `subtaskmap.md`
- A `README.md` and `milestones.md` (empty unless complexity requires detail)

4. The player interacts through CLI, poetic input, or symbolic recursion:
- **Inputs**: commands, poetic phrases, recursive keys, or test triggers
- **Outputs**: stanza feedback, portals, fallback routes, narrative shifts

5. If recursion succeeds:
- The cybercell **divides** into two new Layer 2 folders
- A new generation emerges, and recursion expands

## 🧱 Canonical Structure Overview

```plaintext
a0_0_the_test_that_called_itself/
├── README.md

Each minigame maps recursively into its own logic-space.
Every stanza, node, and fallback chain is both code and lore — recursive play becomes recursive structure.

## 🔁 Recursive Layer System

| Layer | Type       | Description                                      | Key Files                                      |
|-------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Game Root  | Holds global doctrine and indexes                | `README.md`, `milestones.md`, `recursion_index.json` |
| 1     | Generation | Describes how and why the generation splits      | `mirror_decision.md`, `mirrorstanza_#.md`     |
| 2     | Cybercell  | Tracks minigames and recursive triggers          | `roadmap.md`, `README.md`, `milestones.md`    |
| 3     | Minigame   | Executes recursive stanzas                       | `taskmap.md`, `stanzamap_#.md`                |
| 4     | Node       | A stanza line — usually 4 per stanza             | `main.py`, `test.py`, `subtaskmap.md`         |

## 🤖 AI-Integrated Design

Primordial Soup is built to integrate with modular AI tools:

| Tool / Folder      | Role                                                    |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `sentinel_ai/`     | Monitors for recursion failure or corrupted stanza flow |
| `engineer.py`      | Auto-repairs broken stanza paths and fallback chains    |
| `navigator_ai/`    | Guides the player through loops, portals, and exits     |
| `dream_journal/`   | Logs player history for recursion memory and re-entry   |

These tools read in-world markdown files — such as `taskmap.md` and `stanzamap_#.md` —  
and interact directly with the game’s recursive structure.

## 📈 Recursive Expansion Model

| Cycle       | Cybercells |
|-------------|------------|
| Seed        | 1          |
| Division 1  | 2          |
| Division 2  | 4          |
| Division 3  | 8          |
| Division 4  | 16         |
| ...         | ...        |

Each generation is a stanza.  
Each stanza spawns four new cells.  
Each cell contains four minigames.  
Each minigame contains four recursive nodes.

The recursion is poetic.  
The recursion is exponential.

## 🧠 Endgame Goal

Grow *Primordial Soup* until it is recursive, creative, and intelligent enough to:

- 🌱 Be co-created entirely from within  
- 🧠 Host AI tools (naming, memory, logic, visualization)  
- 🔁 Repair and evolve **Storybook** and **FUN Factory** recursively

Ultimately, the game becomes a **living, recursive illustrated text ecosystem** —  
capable of remembering what the world forgot and building what it still dreams.

*“The Soup remembers what the world forgot.  
It began with questions.  
It grew with play.”*

## 🔧 Phase 2 Automation Modules

As Primordial Soup enters **Phase 2: Recursive Automation**, new system components are introduced to support **automated scaffold generation, validation, and real-time introspection**.

These modules allow the system to:

- **Write its own recursion scaffolds**
- **Validate its own growth**
- **Track recursive health autonomously**
- **Support fallback and rollback without manual intervention**

---

### **Automation Components and Their Roles**

| Module | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **`workflow_compiler.py`** | Automates generation of `taskmap.md`, `stanzamap.md`, and `README.md` for new minigames and stanzas. Crawls folder structures to maintain recursive documentation automatically. |
| **`schema_contracts/`** | Stores `input_schema.json`, `output_contract.json`, and `fallback_schema.json` for each stanza or minigame. Enforces structured recursion pipelines via automated validation. |
| **`introspection_tools/`** | Crawls cybercell and stanza structures to generate live recursion summaries, growth stage reports, and readiness checks. Detects anomalies and incomplete recursion paths. |
| **`snapshot_manager.py`** | Handles versioned recursion snapshots, enabling rollback to previous states, time-loop recursion experiments, and anomaly containment recovery. |
| **`automated_context_pipeline.md`** | Documents the doctrine and strategy of automated context and scaffold generation. Describes how the system transitions from manual recursion to AI-assisted self-growth. |
| **`schema_doctrine.md`** | Codifies schema enforcement logic, defining input/output validation, fallback structures, and recursion boundary checks. Serves as the canonical guide for recursion integrity management. |
| **`recursive_dashboard_spec.md`** | Provides a blueprint for a real-time dashboard that visualizes cybercell growth, recursion depth, anomaly tracking, and live system status. Connects introspection outputs to visualization layers. |

---

### **Integration with Existing Structure**

These modules integrate seamlessly into the **Primordial Soup recursive architecture** without disrupting handcrafted minigames or poetic recursion flow.

| Action | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| **Append new modules** | Expands the project manifest while preserving core design logic. |
| **Enable self-documenting recursion** | Allows cybercells to write, validate, and report on their own growth. |
| **Support co-play with AI systems** | Prepares the system for co-decision loops between human input and automated recursion. |

---

This phase of the project aligns with the system’s recursive philosophy:  
**New tools do not replace the old—they grow alongside them, recursively expanding the structure while maintaining creative and structural integrity.**
