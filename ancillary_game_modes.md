# ðŸ“– Ancillary Game Modes Catalog

This document catalogs all planned and conceptual **Ancillary Game Modes** for Primordial Soup.  
These modes **complement the Main Game Mode (the Storybook Interface)**, adding new layers of recursion, interface expansion, and system growth.

All ancillary modes are designed to **emerge from within the storybook interface**â€”they are not separate game systems but recursive mutations of the core experience.

## ðŸ§­ Catalog of Ancillary Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Recursive Map Mode** | Unlocks a **recursive branching map overlay**, visualizing cybercell growth, loop structures, and anomaly locations. Players can zoom in on specific loops or collapse branches to stabilize recursion. |
| **Cybercell Swarm View** | Displays a **top-down swarm view of active cybercells**. Shows division events, cybercell networking, and growth dynamics in real time. Useful for multiplayer and large-scale recursion management. |
| **Anomaly Containment Mode** | Provides players with **real-time anomaly dashboards**, allowing them to monitor recursion instability, isolate problem loops, and deploy containment strategies. |
| **Recursive Debug Mode** | Unlocks a **meta-recursion viewer**, displaying system calls, fallback triggers, and recursion stack flows. Used for advanced play, anomaly analysis, or collaborative system repair. |
| **Multiplayer Co-Recursion Mode** | Allows multiple players to **navigate shared recursion loops**, pass cybercells between users, or collaborate on system stabilization in real time. Shared page states and co-recursive branching are core features. |
| **Temporal Loop Playback Mode** | Enables players to **replay previous recursion paths**, visualize decision trees, and analyze alternate loop outcomes. Useful for strategic learning or anomaly tracing. |
| **Cybercell Laboratory Mode** | A **sandbox environment** where players can create, modify, and experiment with custom recursion loops, cybercell mutations, and system variables. Supports testing of emergent recursion without narrative constraints. |
| **Anomaly Propagation Simulation** | Allows players to **simulate anomaly spread scenarios** across the cybercell network. Used for advanced training, predictive analysis, or in-world research arcs. |
| **Recursive Story Editor** | Gives players the ability to **create their own recursive narratives**, defining custom loops, portals, and anomaly triggers. Results can be shared with others or integrated into the main system as new content. |
| **Meta-Interface Reflection Mode** | Unlocks a **UI recursion layer**, allowing players to modify, observe, or evolve the interface itself as part of gameplay. Recursive menus, adaptive margins, and UI mutations are part of this mode. |

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

- **All modes are recursive expansions of the Storybook Interface**, not external systems.
- Modes may unlock through:
  - Cybercell evolution milestones  
  - Anomaly containment success  
  - Multiplayer collaboration events  
  - Recursion depth achievements

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Each mode listed here will be **expanded into its own section when activated for development**.

For now, this catalog serves as:

- A **design space map**
- A **recursive growth blueprint**
- A **feature prioritization reference**

## ðŸ§¬ Guiding Principle

> **All ancillary modes are recursive reflections of the core.  
They emerge, not as additions, but as evolutions.**
